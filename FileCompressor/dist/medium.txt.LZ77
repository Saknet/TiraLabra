In digital signal processing, data compression, source coding,[1] or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.[2] Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless$ø reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression$Üunnecessary information and removing it.[3] The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the$$of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.[4]

Compression is useful because it helps reduce resource usage, such as data storage space$éssion capacity. Because compressed data must be de$to use, this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch. Data compression is subject to a space‚Äìtime complexity trade-off. For instance, $Oscheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being$5, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of$W, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and uncompress the data

Lossless[edit]
Lossless$y algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy to represent data more concisely without losing information, so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data has$π. For example, an image may have areas of colour that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding "red pixel, $..." the data may be encoded as "279 red pixels". This is a basic example of run-length$Cing; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.

The Lempel‚ÄìZiv (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.[6] DEFLATE is a variation on LZ optimized for de$Äspeed and compression ratio, but$can be slow. DEFLATE is used in PKZIP, Gzip and PNG. LZW (Lempel‚ÄìZiv‚ÄìWelch)$;GIF images. Also noteworthy is the LZR (Lempel-Ziv‚ÄìRenau) algorithm, which serves as the basis for the Zip method. LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most$z, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The$Ctself is often Huffman encoded (e.g. SHRI, LZX). A current LZ-based coding scheme that performs well is LZX, used in Microsoft's CAB format.

The best modern lossless compressors use probabilistic$.ls, such as prediction by partial matching. The Burrows‚ÄìWheeler transform can also be viewed as an indirect $'of statistical modelling.[7]

The class of grammar-based codes are gaining popularity because they can compress highly repetitive text, extremely effectively, for instance, biolog$©data collection of same or related species, huge versioned document$?, internet archives, etc. The basic task of grammar-based codes is constructing a context-free grammar deriving a single string. Sequitur and Re-Pair are practical$E	compression algorithms for which public codes are available.

In a further refinement of these techniques, statistical predictions can be coupled to an algorithm called arithmetic coding. A$, invented by Jorma Rissanen, and turned into a practical method by Witten, Neal, and Cleary, achieves superior compression to the better-known Huffman algorithm and lends itself especially well to adaptive data$dasks where the predictions are strongly context-dependent. Arithmetic coding is used in the bi-level image compression standard JBIG, and the document$,DjVu. The text entry system Dasher is an inverse arithmetic coder.[7]

Lossy[edit]
Lossy data compression is the converse of lossless$-. In these schemes, some loss of information is acceptable. Dropping nonessential detail from the data source can save storage space. Lossy data compression schemes are informed by research on how people perceive$w
in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in luminance than it is to$&color. JPEG image compression works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information.[8] There is a corresponding trade-off between preserving information and reducing size. A number of popular$∏formats exploit these perceptual differences, including those used in music files, images, and video.

Lossy image compression can b$H
digital cameras, to increase storage capacities with minimal degradation of picture quality. Similarly, DVDs use the lossy MPEG-2 video coding format for video compression.

In lossy audi$, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the audio signal. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; speech coding, or voice$	is sometimes distinguished as a separate discipline from audio compression. Different audio and speech compression standards are listed under audio coding formats. Voice compression is used in Internet telephony, for example audio$=for CD ripping and is decoded by audio players.[7]

Theory[edit]
The theoretical background of compression is provided by information theory (which is closely related to algorithmic$<) for lossless compression and rate‚Äìdistortion theory for lossy$3. These areas of study were essentially forged by Claude Shannon, who published fundamental papers on the topic i$late 1940s and early 1950s. Coding theory is also related. The idea of data compression is deeply connected with statistical inference.[9]

Machine learning[edit]
See also: $!
There is a close connection between machine learning and compression: a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data$Ñ (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution) while an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that$B	es best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as justification for data compression as a benchmark for "general intelligence."[10]

Data differencing[edit]
Main article: $&
Data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing:[11][12] Data differencing consists of producing a difference given a source and a target, with patching producing a target$>difference, while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target, and de$J$target given only a compressed file. Thus, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a "difference from nothing." This is the same as considering absolute entropy ($`data compression) as a special case of relative entropy (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.

When one wishes to emphasize the connection, one may use the term differential compression to refer$ë.

Outlook and currently unused potential[edit]
It is estimated that the total amount of data that is stored on the world's storage devices could be further compressed with existing compression algorithms by a remaining average factor of 4.5:1. $≈
mated that the combined technological capacity of the world to store information provides 1,300 exabytes of hardware digits in 2007, but when the corresponding content is optimally compressed, this only represents 295$zShannon information.[13]

Uses[edit]
Audio[edit]
See also: Audio codec
Audio data compression, as distinguished from dynamic range$1has the potential to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data. Audio compression algorithms are implemented in software as audio codecs. Lossy a$Pprovide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications. These algorithms almost all rely on psychoacoustics to eliminate les$Zble or meaningful sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.[2]

In both lossy and lossless compression, information redundancy is reduced, using methods such as coding, pattern recognition, and linear prediction to$U the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data.

The acceptable trade-off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon$©pplication. For example, one 640MB compact disc (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed high fidelity music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7$+in the MP3 format at a medium bit rate. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640MB.[14]

Lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact$)
uplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as Vorbis and MP3. Compression ratios are around 50‚Äì60% of original size,[15] which is similar to those for generic lossless data$†. Lossless compression is unable to attain high$%ratios due to the complexity of waveforms and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like FLAC, Shorten and TTA use linear prediction to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many$se algorithms use convolution with the filter [-1 1] to slightly whiten or flatten the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently. The process is reversed upon de$E.

When audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for editing, it is desirable to work from an unchanged original (uncompressed or losslessly compressed). Processing of a lossi$% file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an un$original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.

A number of$aformats exist. Shorten was an early lossless format. Newer ones include Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), Apple's Appl$+(ALAC), MPEG-4 ALS, Microsoft's Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless (WMA Lossless), Monkey's Audio, TTA, and WavPack. See list of lossless codecs for a complete listing.

Some audio formats feature a combination of a lossy format and a$jrrection; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include MPEG-4 SLS (Scalable to Lossless), WavPack, and OptimFROG DualStream.

Other$]	are associated with a distinct system, such as:

Direct Stream Transfer, used in Super Audio CD
Meridian Lossless Packing$2
DVD-Audio, Dolby TrueHD, Blu-ray and HD DVD

Video compression uses modern coding techniques to reduce redundancy in video data. Most v$Yalgorithms and codecs combine spatial image compression and temporal motion compensation. Video compression is a practical implementation of source coding in information theory. In practice, most video codecs also use audi$Ätechniques in parallel to compress the separate, but combined data streams as one package.[23]

The majority of video compression algorithms use lossy compression. Uncompressed video requires a very high data rate. Although lossless$ycodecs perform an average compression of over factor 3, a typical MPEG-4 lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.[24] As in all$S, there is a trade-off between video quality, cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting artifacts.

Some video$äschemes typically operate on square-shaped groups of neighboring pixels, often called macroblocks. These pixel$D	r blocks of pixels are compared from one frame to the next, and the video compression codec sends only the differences within those blocks. In areas of video with more motion, the$jmust encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to in$in the variable bitrate.

Encoding theory[edit]
Video data may be represented as a series of still image frames. The sequence of$ contains spatial and temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms at$8t to eliminate or code in a smaller size. Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames, or by using perceptual features of human vision. For example, small$`in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in JPEG image c$á
.[25] Some of these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from the original, uncompressed video.

One of the most powerful techniques for compressing video is interframe compression. I$ uses one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to compress the current frame, while intraframe compression uses only$:effectively being image compression.[26]

The most powerful used method works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. If the$1contains areas where nothing has moved, the system simply issues a short command that copies that part of the previous frame, bit-for-bit, into the next one. If sections$Cframe move in a simple manner, the compressor emits a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Inter$ works well for programs that will simply be played back by the viewer, but can cause problems if the video sequence needs to be edited.[27]

Because interframe compression copies data from one frame to another, if the original frame is$ cut out (or lost in transmission), the following frames cannot be reconstructed properly. Some video formats, such as DV, compress each frame independently using intraframe compression. Making 'cuts' in$)-compressed video is almost as easy as editing un$0: one finds the beginning and ending of each frame, and simply copies bit-for-bit each frame that one wants to keep, and discards the frames one doesn't want. Another difference between intraframe and interframe compression is that, with$4systems, each frame uses a similar amount of data. In most interframe systems, certain frames (such as "I frames" in MPEG-2) aren't allowed to copy data from other frames, so they require much more data than$2 nearby.[28]

It is possible to build a computer-based video editor that spots problems caused when I frames are edited out while other$"need them. This has allowed newer formats like HDV to be used for editing. However, this process demands a lot more computing power than editing intraframe compressed video with the same picture quality.

Today, nearly all commonly u$F
compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the ITU-T or ISO) apply a discrete cosine transform (DCT) for spatial redundancy reduction. The DCT that is widely used in this regard was introduc$ôN. Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974.[29] Other methods, such as fractal compression, matching pursuit$Xthe use of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for $ìwavelet coding as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.[26]

Timeline[edit]
The foll$Wtable is a partial history of international video compression standards.

In computer science and information theory, a Huffman cod$cular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A.$3	while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".[1]

The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed $Ævariable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the$≤. As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less$D. Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in linear time to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted.[2] However, although optimal among methods encoding symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always$P all compression methods.

In 1951, David A. Huffman and his MIT information theory classmates were given the choice of a term paper or a final exam. The professor, Robert M. Fano, assigned$Fn the problem of finding the most efficient binary code. Huffman, unable to prove any codes were$H, was about to give up and start studying for the final when he hit upon the idea of using a frequency-sorted binary tree$cquickly proved this method the most efficient.[3]

In doing so, the student outdid his professor, who had worked with information theory inventor Claude Shannon to develop a similar code. By building the tree from the bottom up instead of$'op down, Huffman avoided the major flaw of the suboptimal Shannon-Fano coding

The technique works by creating a binary tree of nodes. These can be stored in a regular array, the size of which depends on the number of symbols, n. A nod$`	either a leaf node or an internal node. Initially, all nodes are leaf nodes, which contain the symbol itself, the weight (frequency of appearance) of$;and optionally, a link to a parent node which makes it easy to read the code (in reverse) starting from a leaf node. Internal nodes contain symbol weight, links to two child nodes and the optional$≥. As a common convention, bit '0' represents following the left child and bit '1$0right child. A finished tree has up to n leaf nodes and n-1 internal nodes. A Huffman tree that omits unused symbols produces the most optimal code lengths.

The process essentially begins with the$ùcontaining the probabilities of the symbol they represent, then a new node whose children are the 2 nodes with smallest probability is created, such that the new node's$1equal to the sum of the children's probability. With the previous 2 nodes merged into one node (thus not considering them anymore), and with the new node being now considered, the procedure is repeated until only$
remains, the Huffman tree.

The simplest construction algorithm uses a priority queue where the node with lowest probability is given highest priority:

Create a leaf node for each symbol and add it to the$á.
While there is more than one node in the queue:
Remove the two nodes of highest priority (lowest probability) from the queue
Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with probability equal to the sum of$´' probabilities.
Add the new node to the queue.
The remaining node is the root node an$Ctree is complete.
Since efficient priority queue data structures require O(log n) time per insertion, and a tree with n leaves has 2n‚àí1 nodes, this algorithm operates in O(n $e, where n is the number of symbols.

If the$ are sorted by probability, there is a linear-time (O(n)) method to create a Huffman tree using two queues, the first one containing the initial weights (along with pointers to the associated leaves), and combined$E%trees) being put in the back of the second queue. This assures that the lowest weight is always kept at the front of one$\two queues:

Start with as many leaves as there are symbols.
Enqueue all leaf nodes into the first queue (by probability in increasing order so that the least likely item is in the head of the queue).
While there is more than one node in$1
s:
Dequeue the two nodes with the lowest weight by examining the fronts of both queues.
Create a new internal node, with the two just-removed nodes as children (either node can be either child) and the sum of their weights as the new weight.
En$Ô
new node into the rear of the second queue.
The remaining node is the root node; the tree has now been generated.
Although linear-time given sorted input, in the general case of arbitrary$(using this algorithm requires pre-sorting. Thus, since sorting takes O(n log n) time in the general case, both methods have the same overall complexity.

In many cases, time complexity is not very important in the choice of$’here, since n here is the number of symbols in the alphabet, which is typically a very small$C(compared to the length of the message to be encoded); whereas complexity analysis concerns the behavior when n grows to be very large.

It is generally beneficial to minimize the variance of codeword$∏. For example, a communication buffer receiving Huffman-encoded data may need to be larger to deal with especially long symbols if the tree is$'unbalanced. To minimize variance, simply break ties between queues by choosing the item in the first queue. This modification will retain the mathematical optimality of the Huffman coding while both minimizing variance and$the length of the longest character code.

Here's an example of optimized Huffman coding using the French subject string "j'aime aller sur le bord de l'eau les jeudis ou les jours impairs". Note that the original$ãtree structure would be different from the given example:
Decompression[edit]
Generally speaking, the process of d$7 is simply a matter of translating the stream of prefix codes to individual byte values, usually by travers$LHuffman tree node by node as each bit is read from the input stream (reaching a leaf node necessarily terminates the search for that particular byte value). Before this can take place, however, the $∆must be somehow reconstructed. In the simplest case, where character frequencies are fairly predictable, the tree can be p$j (and even statistically adjusted on each compression cycle) and thus reused every time, at the expense of at least some measure of$Zefficiency. Otherwise, the information to reconstruct the tree must be sent a priori. A naive approach might be to prepend the frequency count of each character to the compression stream. Unfortunately$¥overhead in such a case could amount to several kilobytes, so this method has little practical use. If the data is compressed using canonical encoding, the$)	ion model can be precisely reconstructed with just B2^B bits of information (where B is the number of$.per symbol). Another method is to simply prepend the Huffman tree, bit by bit, to the output stream. For example, assuming that the value of 0 represents a parent node and 1 a leaf node, whenever the latter is encountered the tree building routine$÷reads the next 8 bits to determine the character value of that particular leaf. The process continues recursively until the last leaf node is reached; at$`oint, the Huffman tree will thus be faithfully reconstructed. The overhead using such a method ranges from roughly 2 to 320 bytes (assuming an 8-bit alphabet). Many other techniques are possible as well. In any case, since$Ÿcompressed data can include unused "trailing bits" the decompressor must be able to determine when to stop producing output. This can be accomplished by either transmitting the length of the de$¡along with the compression model or by defining a special code symbol to signify the end of input (the latter method can adversely affect$Plength optimality, however).

Main properties[edit]
The probabilities used can be generic ones for the application domain that are based on average experience, or they$]the actual frequencies found in the text being compressed. This requires that a frequency table must be stored with the$I text. See the Decompression section above for more informa$ut the various techniques employed for this purpose.

Optimality[edit]
Although Huffman's original algorithm is optimal for a symbol-by-symbol coding (i.e., a stream of unrelated symbols) with a known input probability distribution, it is not$É	when the symbol-by-symbol restriction is dropped, or $5	probability mass functions are unknown. Also, if symbols are not independent and identically distributed, a single code may be insufficient for optimality. Other methods such as arithmetic coding and LZW$often have better compression capability: Both of these methods can combine an arbitrary number of symbols for more efficient coding, and generally adapt to the actual input statistics, useful when$probabilities are not precisely known or vary significantly within the stream. However, these methods have higher computational complexity. Also, both arithmetic coding and LZW were historically a subject of some concern over patent issues$¢as of mid-2010, the most commonly used techniques for these alternatives to Huffman coding have passed into the public domain as the early patents have expired.

However, the limitations of$rshould not be overstated; it can be used adaptively, accommodating unknown, changing, or context-dependent probabilities. In the case of known in$0
and identically distributed random variables, combining symbols ("blocking") reduces inefficiency in a way that approaches optimality as the number of$_	combined increases. Huffman coding is optimal when each input symbol is a known independent and identically distributed random variable having a probability that$]n the inverse of a power of two.

Prefix codes tend to have inefficiency on small alphabets, where probabilities often fall between these optimal points. The worst case for Huffman coding can happen when th$my of a symbol exceeds 2‚àí1 = 0.5, making the upper limit of inefficiency unbounded. These situations often respond well to a form of blocking called run-length encoding; for the simple case of Bernoulli processes, Golomb $; is a provably optimal run-length code.

For a set of symbols with a uniform probability distribution and a number of members which$Éower of two, Huffman coding is equivalent to simple binary block encoding, e.g., ASCII coding. This reflects the fact that compression is not possible with such an input.

Lempel‚ÄìZiv‚ÄìWelch (LZW) is a universal lossless data$ialgorithm created by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. It was published by Welch in 1984 as an improved implementation of the LZ78 algorithm$OLempel and Ziv in 1978. The algorithm is simple to implement, and has the potential for very high throughput in hardware implementations.[1] It was t$|of the widely used Unix file compression utility compress, and is used in the GIF image format.

Algorithm[edit]
The scenario described by Welch's 1984 paper[1] encodes sequences of 8-bit data as fixed-length 12-bit codes. The codes from 0 to 255 represent 1-character$dconsisting of the corresponding 8-bit character, and the codes 256 through 4095 are created in a dictionary for sequences encountered in the data as it is encoded. At each stage in compression, input bytes are gathered into a$r	 until the next character would make a sequence for which there is no code yet in the dictionary. The code for the sequence (without that character) is added to the output, and a new code (for the sequence with$N!dictionary.

The idea was quickly adapted to other situations. In an image based on a color table, for example, the natural character alphabet is the set of$G indexes, and in the 1980s, many images had small color tables (on the order of 16 colors). For such a reduced alphabet, the full 12-bit codes yielded poor compression unless the image was large, so the idea of a variable-width code was introduced:$ptypically start one bit wider than the symbols being encoded, and as each code size is used up, the code width increases by 1 bit, up to some prescribed maximum ($¢
12 bits).

Further refinements include reserving a code to indicate that the code table should be cleared (a "clear code", typically the first value immediately after the values for the individual alphabet characters), and$Æe end of data (a "stop code", typically one greater than the clear code). T$ allows the table to be reinitialized after it fills up, which lets the encoding adapt to changing patterns in the input data. Smart encoders can monitor the compression efficiency and clear$∑whenever the existing table no longer matches the input well.

Since the codes are added in a manner determined by the data, the decoder mimics building the table as it sees the resulting codes. It is critical that the encoder and$f	agree on which variety of LZW is being used: the size of the alphabet, the maximum code width, whether variable-width encoding$a, the initial code size, whether to use the clear and stop codes (and what values they have). Most formats that employ LZW build this information into the format specification or provide explicit fields for them in a compression header$! data.

Encoding[edit]
A high level view of the encoding algorithm is shown here:

Initialize the dictionary to contain all strings of length one.
Find the longest string W in$Rhat matches the current input.
Emit the dictionary index for W to output and remove W from the input.
Add W followed by the next symbol in the input to$t.
Go to Step 2.
A dictionary is initialized to contain the single-character strings corresponding to all the possible input $:	s (and nothing else except the clear and stop codes if they're being used). The algorithm works by scanning through the input string for successively longer substrings until it finds one that is not in the dictionary. When such a$his found, the index for the string without the last character (i.e., the longest substring that is in the dictionary) is retrieved from the dictionary and sent to output, and the new string (including$û) is added to the dictionary with the next available code. The last input character is then used as the next starting point to scan for substrings.

In this way, successively longer strings are registered in$¬and made available for subsequent encoding as single output values. The algorithm works best on data with repeated patterns, so the initial parts of a message will see little compression. As the message grows, however, th$0 ratio tends asymptotically to the maximum.[2][clarification needed]

Decoding[edit]
The decoding algorithm works by reading a value from the encoded input and outputting the corresponding string$?
initialized dictionary. In order to rebuild the dictionary in the same way as it was built during encoding, it also obtains the next value from the input and adds to$zthe concatenation of the current string and the first character of the string obtained by decoding the next input value, or$P#just output if the next value can not be decoded (I$&is unknown to the decoder, then it must be the value that will be added to the dictionary this iteration, and so its first character must be the same as the$(of the current string being sent to decoded output). The$r then proceeds to the next input value (which was already read in as the "next value" in the previous pass) and repeats the process until there is no more input, at which point the final$†is decoded without any more additions to the dictionary.

In this way the decoder builds up a dictionary which is identical to that used by the encoder, and uses it to decode subsequent input values. Thus the full$xdoes not need be sent with the encoded data; just the initial dictionary containing the single-character strings is sufficient (and is typically defined beforehand within the encoder and decoder rather than being explicitly$œ.)

Variable-width codes[edit]
If v$ are being used, the encoder and decoder must be careful to change the width at the same points in the encoded data, or they will disagree about where the boundaries between individual codes fall in the stream. In the standard version$€increases the width from p to p + 1 when a sequence œâ + s is encountered that is not in the table (so that a code must be added for it) but the next available code$Ois 2p (the first code requiring p + 1 bits). The encoder emits the code for œâ at width p (since that code does not require$\, and then increases the code width so that the next code emitted will be p + 1 bits wide.

The decoder is always one code behind the encoder in building the table, so when it se$†for œâ, it will generate an entry for code 2p ‚àí 1. Since this is the point where the encoder will increase the code width, the decoder must increase the width here as well: at$oit generates the largest code that will fit in p bits.

Unfortunately some early implementations of the encoding algorithm increase the code width and then emit œâ at the new width instead$\old width, so that to the decoder it looks like the$0 changes one code too early. This is called "Early Change"; it caused so much confusion that Adobe now allows both versions in PDF files, but includes an explicit flag in the header of each LZW-compressed stream to indicate whether $ª is being used. Out of graphics file formats capable of using LZW compression, TIFF uses early change, while GIF and most others don't.

When the table is cleared in response to a clear code, both encoder and decoder$z the code width after the clear code back to the initial code width, starting with the code immediately following$\.

Packing order[edit]
Since the codes emitted typically do not fall on byte boundaries, the encoder and decoder must agree on how codes are packed into bytes. The two common methods are LSB-First ("Least Significant Bit First") and M$.Most Significant Bit First"). In LSB-First packing, the first code is aligned so that the least significant bit of the code falls in$/"first stream byte, and if the code has more than 8 bits, the high order bits left over are aligned with the least significant bits of the next byte; further codes are packed with LSB going into$Z not yet used in the current stream byte, proceeding into further bytes as necessary. MSB-first packing aligns the first code so that its most significant bit falls in the MSB of the first stream byte, with overflow aligned with$=next byte; further codes are written with MSB going into the most significant bit not yet used in the current stream byte.

GIF files use LSB-First packing order. TIFF files and PDF files use M$6

Example[edit]
The following example illustrates the LZW algorithm in action, showing the status of the output and the dictionary at every stage, both in encoding and decoding the data. This$¢	has been constructed to give reasonable compression on a very short message. In real text data, repetition is generally less pronounced, so longer input streams are typically necessary before th$úbuilds up efficiency.

The plaintext to be encoded (from an alphabet using only the capital letters) is:

TOBEORNOTTOBEORTOBEORNOT#
The # is a marker used to show that the end of the message has been reached. There are thus 26 symbols in t$◊alphabet (the 26 capital letters A through Z), plus the stop code #. We arbitrarily assign these the values 1 through 26 for the letters, and 0 for '#'. (Most flavors of LZW would put$Ñafter the data alphabet, but nothing in the basic algorithm requires that. The encoder and decoder only have to agree what value it has.)

A computer will rend$úse as strings of bits. Five-bit codes are needed to give sufficient combinations to encompass this set of 27 values. The dictionary is initialized with these 27 values. As t$7grows, the codes will need to grow in width to accommodate the additional entries. A 5-bit code gives 25 = 32 possible combinations of bits, so when the 33rd dictionary word is created, the algorithm will have to switch at that point from$östrings to 6-bit strings (for all code values, including those which were previously output with only five bits). Note that since the all-zero code 00000 is used, and is labeled "0", the 33rd dictionary entry will be labeled 32. (P$ú
generated output is not affected by the code-width change, but once a 6-bit value is $U
in the dictionary, it could conceivably be the next code emitted, so the width for subsequent output shifts to 6 bits to accommodate that.)

The initial$íthen, will consist of the following entries:

DAVE DASHAWAY 
THE YOUNG AVIATOR

CHAPTER I$-‚ÄôS MODEL
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean to say that new-fangled air ship of yours will fly, Dave Dashaway?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs only a model, as you see.‚Äù
‚ÄúWould the real one go up, though$SIt might. I hope so. But this is a start, anyway.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, and a fine one,‚Äù said Ned Towner, enthusiastically. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a smart boy, Dave, and everybody says so$wI wish my dear old father was living,‚Äù remarked Dave in a tone of sadness and regret. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt much about sky sailing he did$#know. In these times, when everybody is so interested in airships, he would be bound to make his mark.‚Äù
The two, manly-appearing youths stood i$ä loft of the dilapidated old barn of Silas Warner‚Äôs place in Brookville. It held a work bench and some tools, and on one end$ybench was the model at which they were looking.
It was neat enough and intricate$, being made by a mere lad, to have attracted the attention of any inventor or workman. An outsider, however, would$Ubeen puzzled, for while its shape suggested a bird kite with an umbrella top, it had so many rods, joints and levers that a casual observer would have wondered what they were all there for.
Dave showed a good deal of pride in his model. I$ücost him all his loose change to buy the material to construct it, and many a busy hour during the preceding few weeks. He sighed as he turned from it, with the words:
‚ÄúAll I need now is some silk$ïver those wings. That finishes it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen what will you do?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù replied Dave vaguely, ‚Äúthen I hope I can find some practical airship man who will tell me if it‚Äôs any good$úSay, it will be a fortune if$orks, won‚Äôt it, Dave?‚Äù exclaimed Ned.
‚ÄúOh, hardly that. They are getting up so many new kinds all of the time. It would get me into$swim, though. All I want is to have a chance to make the acquaintance of some expert airman. I reckon the flying fever was born in me, Ned.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs quite natural,‚Äù responded Ned. ‚ÄúYour father must$∑been famous in his line, according to all those scrap-book articles you showed me the other day.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnyhow, I‚Äôm getting tired of the dull life$%leading here,‚Äù went on Dave seriously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to do something besides slave for a man who drives me to the limit, and amount t$Lin the world.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood for you!‚Äù cried Ned, giving his friend and chum an encouraging slap on the back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get there‚Äîyou‚Äôre the kind of a boy that always does$£Hey, there! are you ever going to start?‚Äù rang out a harsh, complaining voice in the yard outside.
Dave hurriedly threw an old horse blanket over his model and glanced$yof the window.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mr. Warner,‚Äù he said, while Ned made a wry face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to be going.‚Äù
Old Silas$X stood switching his cane around and growling out threats, as Dave reached the yard and crossed it to where a thin bony horse and an old rickety wagon$ñ. The vehicle held a dozen bags filled with potatoes, every one of which Dave had planted and dug as his hardened hands bore proof.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll quit wasting my time,$]Dashaway,‚Äù carped the mean-faced old man, ‚Äúor there‚Äôs going to be trouble.‚Äù
‚ÄúI was just showing Ned about the loft,‚Äù explained Dave.
‚ÄúYah! Fine lot of more valuable time you‚Äôve been wasting there, too,‚Äù snort$¬Warner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put a stop to some of it, you mark me. Now then, you get those bags of taters down to Swain‚Äôs warehouse and back again afore six o‚Äôclock, or you‚Äôll get no supper. There‚Äôs a lot more of those$Äto dig, but an hour or two this evening will finish them.‚Äù
Dave‚Äôs face was set and indignant$Zhe passed no more words with the unreasonable old man who called himself, and was in fact, legally his guardian.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep you company as far as our house,‚Äù said Ned, as Dave got up into the wagon seat$àhe climbed up beside his friend, heedless of the grumbling$	old man about over loading.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pretty mean old fellow,‚Äù flared out Ned, as they drove out of the yard and into the country road leading towards the town. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the talk$Sneighborhood, the way that old miser makes you work.‚Äù
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind$?ork if he would only treat me half human,‚Äù replied Dave in a subdued tone.
‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt in him to do it,‚Äù scolded Ned. ‚ÄúIf I was in your place I‚Äôd just cut out, and let him find some other fellow$khis slaving. Why, my folks say your father left enough to take care of you in a good way. And send you to school, and all that. I‚Äôd find out my legal rights, if I were you, and$3etch that old fellow to time.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt would be no use, Ned,‚Äù declared Dave. ‚ÄúI tried it once. I went over to Brocton, where the lawyer of my father‚Äôs estate lives, and had a talk with him.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe said that$_
 had left no property except the old hotel at Brocton. It is old, for a fact, and needs lots of repairs, and the lawyer says that this takes most of the income and makes the rent amount to almost nothing. I found out, though, that$zis a relative of Mr. Warner, and that Warner gives most of the repairing jobs to other relatives of his. I went and saw the court judge, and he told me that Mr. Warner‚Äôs report, made each year, showed up clear and straight.‚Äù
‚ÄúJudge an$ü of old Warner?‚Äù insinuated Ned.
‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt wonder.‚Äù
‚ÄúNeither would I. It‚Äôs strange to me, though, Dave, that your father ever made such a notorious old skinflint your guardian$ÑHe didn‚Äôt,‚Äù asserted Dave.
‚ÄúWho did, then?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe court, and I had no voice in it. Mr. Warner let me stay at the school I was attending when my father died, for about a year. Then he claimed the estate coul$“ bear the expense, and he has had me home ever since.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they sell the old hotel$Ngive you a chance to live like other boys who are heirs?‚Äù demanded Ned, in his ardent, innocent way.
‚ÄúMr. Warner says the property can‚Äôt be sold till I am of age,‚Äù explained Dave. ‚ÄúThat time I went away and got work in$kcity, I even sent Mr. Warner half of what I earned, but he$.the sheriff after me, made me come home, and said if I tried it again he would send me to a reformatory till I was twenty-one.‚Äù
‚ÄúSay that‚Äôs terrible!‚Äù cried Ned, rousing up in his honest wrath. ‚ÄúOh, say‚Äîlook there!$dWhoa!‚Äù shouted Dave, but there was no need of the mandate. In sudden excitement and surprise he had pulled old Dobbin up dead short. Then he followed the direction indicated by the pointing finger of his companion. Both sat star$*xedly over their heads. The air was filled with a faint whizzing sound, and the object that made it came within$eview for just a minute. Then it passed swiftly beyond their range of vision where the high trees lining the road intervened.
‚ÄúAn airship‚Äîa real$!‚Äù cried Ned with bated breath.
‚ÄúYes. It must have come from the big aero meet at Fairfield,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúIs there one there?‚Äù$g
 read about it in the paper.‚Äù
Both Dave and Ned had seen an airship before. Besides two that had passed over the tow$fday previous, they had once witnessed an ascent at a circus at Brocton.
Every nerve in Dave‚Äôs body was thrilling with animation. He had dropped the lines, and Dobbin had wandered to the side of the road seeking for grass, nearly tipping over$boad. Dave righted the wagon.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù spoke Ned, ‚Äústop at the house, will you?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúI want to ask the folks to let me go to town with you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be glad to have you, Ned$'All right. You know the common is right on top of the hill, and one$fellows said they could watch the airships yesterday for miles and miles.‚Äù
A turn in the highway brought the boys to the Towner place. Ned ran into the house and soon returned all satisfaction and excitement, his pockets filled with cooki$¥apples.
‚ÄúMother says I can go with you, Dave,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú$(help you unload, and we can drive over to the town common and join the crowds.‚Äù
Dave‚Äôs head was full of airships$ethe incident of the hour made him forget his troubles. He and Ned chatted and lunched animatedly all the way to Brookville.
The business par$Å	little town was located on a hill, as Ned had said, but they did not go there at once. The warehouse where Dave was to deliver his load of potatoes was near the railroad, and there$}rove.
They found no one in charge of the office, and had to wait till the proprietor arrived, which was nearly an hour later. It was quite six o‚Äôclock before they got$cotatoes unloaded. Then Dave drove up the hill.
Quite a crowd was gathered in the public square. The boys hitched old Dobbin near the post office and joined the throng.
Everybody was talking airships. It seemed that half-a-dozen had pass$•full sight. Three of them had sailed directly over the town. On$/dropped about a hundred printed dodgers, telling$)the aero meet at Fairfield, and Dave was glad to get hold of one of these.
The excited throng was in great expectation$6 appearance of another airship. It was getting on towards meal time, and quite a number had left the common, when a chorus of sound echoed out:
‚ÄúA‚Äîah!‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another one.‚Äù
‚ÄúHurrah‚Äîlook! look!‚Äù
‚ÄúA‚Äîa$J
The last utterance expressed disappointment. A swift sailing aeroplane had come into view, circled, and was lost to sight over the crest of a distant hill.
There was a great attraction fo$>hums in the crowd and bustle about the common. It was quite dusk before they started away. Dave realized that he would have to account for every minute of his time, and expected a scene when he got back home. He had seen so much, however, and heard$h talk on his favorite theme, airships, that a glimmering idea came to him$#he was soon to know more of them.
Dave kept up his spirits bravely, and he and Ned chatted over dreams and plans to find a chance to get over to Fairfield some day soon, and view all the glories$™ great aero meet close at hand.
It had become quite dark by the time they neared$urn in the road leading to the Towner place. Old Dobbin was plodding along the dusty$Jat his usual leisurely gait, when suddenly Ned stretched ou$:hand and caught the arm of his comrade in a great state of excitement.
‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúDo you hear that, Dave?‚Äù
‚ÄúSure enough,‚Äù responded Dave, checking the horse,$≠both of them sat rigid on the wagon seat and stared up into the sky.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another one of them,‚Äù said Ned. ‚ÄúListen.‚Äù
There was a quick snappy sound, like the sharp popping of an exhaust.$Fflashing streamer of light, outlining a dark object that both the entranced lads knew to be a belated airship making its way homeward.
A$Vmoment something swished through the air. Dave did not see it, he rather felt it. Before his senses had fairly taken it in, however, old Dobbin made a jump.
Ten feet ahead the slow going animal plunged, as Dave had never seen him do before. Then he$in affrighted veer. Over into the ditch went the crazy old vehicle with a crash. Dave, clinging $Eseat, was simply flung sideways, but his companion$-lifted bodily. Head over heels out of the wagon went Ned, landing sprawling in the mud.
CHAPTER II

FROM THE CLOUDS
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happened?‚Äù shouted out Ned Towner, in dismay and confusion.
‚ÄúDobbin ran away, t$[all,‚Äù replied Dave quickly.
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù asked Ned, righting himself and looking around him in a puzzled wa$PSomething struck him.‚Äù
Dave made the declaration as he dismounted cautiously from the wagon. Dobbin lay on his side as if perfectly satisfied with a rest in the soft dirt. One wheel of the wagon was splintered to pieces and$'box had caved in on one side.
‚ÄúHold his head till I slip the traces,‚Äù ordered Dave.
They got Dobbin to his feet and managed to pull the wagon up the slight slant.
‚ÄúWhew!‚Äù whistled Ned, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a pretty bad wreck.‚Äù
‚ÄúY$•assented Dave soberly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what Mr. Warner will say about it.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet him say!‚Äù flared out Ned. ‚ÄúThe old thing was ready for the junk pile, long ago$^That won‚Äôt help much,‚Äù said Dave.
As he spoke Dave went over to a stretch of broken fence and dragged a long rail up to the wagon. This he strapped to the hub of the broken wheel.
‚ÄúI guess$G
 will drag home,‚Äù he observed, as he hitched up Dobbin anew, ‚Äúbut we will have to walk.‚Äù
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù broke in Ned suddenly, ‚Äúyou think something hit the horse and started him up?$^I am sure of that,‚Äù declared Dave.
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs one of those Bolgers. See, we‚Äôre right at the end of their lot. You know they pelted you once before?‚Äù
‚ÄúI know$ß
admitted Dave, ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt see or hear anything of them just now.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôd lay in ambush in that brush yonder all night to play a trick on either of us,‚Äù insis$´Ned.
The Bolgers were a family crowd very numerous and troublesome. They had often pestered Dave in the past, and, aroused by the suggestion of his comrade,$Awalked back the road a dozen feet or so, peering sharply into the straggly brush lining it.
‚ÄúWhat is it, Dave?‚Äù inquired Ned, as his friend uttered a quick cry. He noticed that Dave had come to a short stop and was stooping over in$‡	.
‚ÄúMy foot kicked something,‚Äù explained Dave, groping about. ‚ÄúWhy, I wonder what this is?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù put in Ned curiously.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bundle of some kind.$F	y, yes,‚Äù added Ned, peering sharply at the object in Dave‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúIt looks like a rolled-up sweater.‚Äù
‚ÄúSome one must have dropped it from a wagon,‚Äù said Dave. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else here than a$q, though.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a look at it,‚Äù suggested Ned eagerly.
‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù said Dave, as his comrade reached out to unroll the wadded-up bundle. ‚ÄúI$åtoo dark to make out anything plain.‚Äù
The moon had not yet come up, and on that tree-lined road it was pretty dark. Dave moved up to the wagon. Under the front seat was an oil lantern$uhe secured this and lighted it.
‚ÄúWhy, I should say there was something else besides a sweater!‚Äù exclaimed Ned excitedly, as Dave unrolled the garment on the seat cushion.
‚ÄúYes,$Ç‚Äôs a pocket book,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúOpen it‚Äîlet‚Äôs see what‚Äôs in it,‚Äù suggested Ned.
‚ÄúA watch,‚Äù spoke$V
And some money. Why, this is a big find, Dave! Wonder who lost it? And look, there‚Äôs a medal‚Äîa gold medal.‚Äù
Dave took$gup and inspected it closely. His fingers trembled with excitement as he did so, for the pretty bauble suggested the theme nearest and dearest to his heart.
The main plate of the medal was chas$ëthe outline of an airship. Pendant from this by two tiny gold chains was a little strip of metal, and on$Awas inscribed the words: ‚ÄúPresented to Robert A. King by the C. A. A. First Endurance Prize.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, I know where this came from!‚Äù cried Dave suddenly.
‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes$V
ere?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt fell out of that airship that just went over us. It was this bundle that hit the horse and made him run away.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy‚Äîwhy‚Äî‚Äù stammered Ned in great excitement. ‚ÄúDo you think so$ƒ	 am sure of it. That name there, too‚Äî‚ÄòKing‚Äô. I read about him being down at the meet at Fairfield in a paper yesterday, and ‚ÄòC. A. A.‚Äô means Central Aero Association.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs$† much money, Dave?‚Äù questioned Ned.
‚ÄúAbout fifty dollars.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with it?‚Äù
‚ÄúReturn it to the owner.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course, but how$Tget it to him?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll find a way,‚Äù replied Dave thoughtfully. ‚ÄúHe will be pretty glad to get back that medal.$i should think so, too.‚Äù
Dave carefully replaced the pocket book in the sweater, rolled it up, and stowed it$,corner of the seat space. Then he took up the lines and started up Dobbin, both he and Ned walking along beside the wagon.
Ned had been dazzled with the sight of the valuable contents$±	weater bundle, and could talk of nothing else. Dave let him talk$3did not say much. He had the broken wagon and a thought of the way that mishap would stir up his guardian on his mind, and it was not a very pleasant thing to think about. At the same time, Dav$Æa vague glimmering idea that events were framing up that brought him in closer touch all the time with aeronautics.
‚ÄúSay, Dave, I‚Äôll go ho$/you if you like,‚Äù suggested Ned, as they neared the Towner place.
‚ÄúThank you, Ned, but I don‚Äôt think you had better.‚Äù
‚ÄúI could help you put up the horse and all that, you know$@No,‚Äù responded Dave definitely. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a storm to face, and I might just as well face it alone and have it over with.‚Äù
‚ÄúTell me what you decide to do about getting that stuff back to the airship man, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù
‚ÄúI certainly shall$|úI wish you could arrange to take it to this Mr. King yourself, Dave,‚Äù went on Ned. ‚ÄúHe would be sure to appreciate it, and help you get an insight into the doings down at the aero meet in whic$øare so interested. Well, see you to-morrow! Good night!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood night, Ned,‚Äù responded Dave, and started on his lonely way. He wondered how his guardian would take his late coming and the broken wagon. As the rail supporting$)heel clattered over the rutty road leading into the yard, Dave drew Dobbin to a halt and stared up wonderingly at the one side window of the barn loft.
There Dave saw a light, or rather the receding radiance of$,
as if some person was just descending the stairs with a lantern. It was a very unusual circumstance for anybody to visit the loft except himself. He had always used it as a work room, the grain and hay being stored in a shed built onto$∆ble. The next moment Mr. Warner came out from the barn.
He carried a lantern in one hand. In the other was a big sledge hammer. The old man looked ugly, excited and was out of breath. The$Æhe caught sight of Dave he hurried forward, dropping the hammer.
‚ÄúAha! so you‚Äôve got home at last, have you?‚Äù he snarled.
‚ÄúYes, sir. I‚Äôm afraid I am a little late,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúA little late‚Äî$0!‚Äù snarled the old man. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre two hours behind time. Now then, I want to know what this means?‚Äù
‚ÄúI was delayed in finding Mr. Swain at$Üwarehouse,‚Äù explained Dave, ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt make that an excuse. There were some airships going over the town. Everybody was looking at them, and I couldn‚Äôt help doing it myself.‚Äù
‚ÄúAirships!‚Äù shouted Warner. ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs on$û	, as you call ‚Äôem, that won‚Äôt fill your head with nonsense any more.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù inquired Dave anxiously.
‚ÄúI mean that I won‚Äôt stand you loitering and wasting my time any more,‚Äù declared Dave‚Äôs guardian. $j‚Äôve settled one end of your nonsense. I‚Äôve smashed that crazy model of yours, and if I hear any more of this airship rot, I‚Äôll give you the trouncing$Ü	life.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve‚Äîsmashed‚Äîmy‚Äîmodel!‚Äù gasped Dave, in unspeakable amazement and dismay.
‚ÄúYes, I have. What about it?‚Äù challenged the irate old tyrant.$ú dared to‚Äî‚Äù began Dave, his face on fire, and he felt as if he could no longer control himself. Then fortunately at just that moment there was a diversion. His guardian‚Äôs eye chanc$∂ fall upon the dismantled wagon with one wheel gone and the box supported by the dragging fence rail.
With a shriek of rage that was almost a bellow he grabbed Dave$[arm and dragged him up to the wrecked vehicle.
‚ÄúWho did that?‚Äù he raged. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me‚Äîit‚Äôs a piece of spite work! $N, I say?‚Äù
CHAPTER III

BREAKING AWAY
Dave Dashaway was almost speechless. His tyrant master had struck him in a tender spot, indeed. Not that Dave had ever been foolish enough to build extravagant hopes on his model. It had$Dall guess work and an experiment. However, his soul had been wrapped up in his labor, he$%
proud and pleased with his progress as an inventor, and that mean, vengeful act of the old man roused him up terribly.
‚ÄúWhat buste$Nwagon?‚Äù demanded Mr. Warner, grasping Dave‚Äôs arm till the pain was unbearable.
Dave jerked loose, and panting and angry-faced confronted his guardian with a look that made the old man hesitate. His lip trembled, but he hel$Wspeech as steady as he could,$replied:
‚ÄúDobbin got scared and ran into the ditch.‚Äù
‚ÄúWith your star-gazing after those airships I‚Äôll warrant.‚Äù
This was so near the truth that Dave did not reply.
‚ÄúWhat do you suppose will pay for all$Adamage to that wagon?‚Äù demanded Warner.
‚ÄúI suppose my hard work will,‚Äù bluntly replied Dave.
‚ÄúYour$1
‚Äîbah! It looks as if you was worked hard, fritting half of the afternoon away, spending hours and$
on that worthless piece of trumpery up in the barn loft. I‚Äôve settled for good and all. Now you put up$fhorse, get your supper, and go to$room. You dare to leave it till I say so, and I‚Äôll just call the sheriff up here again$0see what he says about affairs.‚Äù
This was an old-time threat of his guardian. It was worn so threadbare that Dave did not pay much attention to it. He proceeded silently$õhis task, unhitched Dobbin, led him to his stall, and made him comfortable for the night with feed and bedding.
As Dave came out into the yard again he made a speedy run$_	wagon. His guardian had been poking about the vehicle, and had discovered the sweater roll. This he now held, turning it over and over in his hand and viewing it curiously.
‚ÄúHere!‚Äù shouted Dave, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs mine.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, is it?‚Äù snapp$´old man, holding the bundle out of Dave‚Äôs reach. ‚ÄúWhat is it? I‚Äôm going to see.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean that it belongs to me,‚Äù Dave corrected himself, ‚Äúbut I found it.‚Äù
$Ä‚Äù
‚ÄúIt fell out of an airship. It lighted on Dobbin‚Äôs back. That‚Äôs what made him run away.‚Äù
‚ÄúFell from$\?‚Äù repeated old Warner with a sniff of disbelief. ‚ÄúRomancing, hey?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, I am not, I am telling you the truth,‚Äù persisted Dave.
‚ÄúHello! hello! Here, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù
Mr.$•had opened the sweater. His miserly old eyes fairly gloated over the pocket book and its contents$Kthin cruel lips moved as if he was smacking them over a meal.
‚ÄúYou found this, you say?‚Äù he inquired$,es, I did,‚Äù responded Dave brusquely, none too well pleased with the way things had turned out.
‚ÄúWell, finders keepers!‚Äù chuckled the old man with a cunning laugh.
‚ÄúNobody is going to have that pocket book but the owner,‚Äù sai$’staunchly.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll arrange about that, you young insolent!‚Äù retorted Mr. Warner.
‚ÄúYou$Lhave to, in the right way, too,‚Äù asserted Dave, who was quite nettled.
‚ÄúEh‚Äîwhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù shouted the old man.
‚ÄúJust what I said. If you will look at that medal in that pocket book,$1
find that the owner‚Äôs name is on it. It is ‚ÄòRobert King‚Äô. All you‚Äôve got to do is to send his property back to him. I happen to know$àhe is at Fairfield now, and a letter directed there would reach him.‚Äù
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù blurted out old Warner, ‚ÄúI know what to do, I guess, about my own business.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is my$	, too,‚Äù insisted Dave. ‚ÄúI found that property, and I‚Äôm honest enough to want to get it right back to the man who lost it.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou get into$ohouse quick as you can, and mind your own business and keep your mouth shut, or I‚Äôll make it pretty interesting for you,‚Äù bawled the old man.
Dave closed his lips tightly. He had gone through a$gtrying ordeal. It had made him almost desperate. It had come so thick and fast, one indignity after another, that Dave had not found time to break down. His just wrath over the destruction of the model was lessened by the appropria$/sweater bundle.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I won‚Äôt stand,‚Äù declared Dave, as he made his way into the house. ‚ÄúI know who that property belongs to, and if Mr. Warner tries any tricks, I‚Äôll expose him.‚Äù
Dave felt sure$chis tyrant master would not do the square thing. He might not dare to keep the pocket book and its contents and say nothing about it. Dave felt sure, however, that in any event Mr. Warn$™give it up without a big reward. This humiliated Dave, somehow, on account of his father and his own liking for aeronautics.$L felt more than kindly to one of that profession, and would have been glad to return the lost pocket book for nothing.
Dave glanced into the kitchen as he passed its open door. The scraps of food o$runcovered deal table did not at all appeal to his appetite. Besides that, he was too stirred up to care to eat. He went up$Plittle room in the attic and sat down at$open window to think.
Dave felt that a crisis in his affairs had been reached. His mind ran back rapidly over$=past life. He could find nothing cheering in it since the time he was removed from a pleasant boarding school upon the death of his father. The latter had been traveling in foreign parts at$à
giving lectures on aeronautics, of which science he was an ardent student.
Since then old Silas Warner had led his young ward a very wretched life. Several letters had come addressed to Mr. Dashaway. These Mr.$rnot shown to Dave, but had told him that they amounted to nothing of importance. Dave had noticed$>	se, with some other papers, his guardian kept in a strong manilla envelope in his desk.
Dave had known nothing but neglect and hardship$ÑSilas Warner in the past. He saw no prospects now of any betterment of his condition. After what had happened during$eday the man would be more unbearable than ever.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to do it,‚Äù murmured Dave, after a long period of painful thought. ‚ÄúMy life will be spoiled if I stay here. I‚Äôll never learn anything,$amount to anything. There is only one way out.‚Äù
Dave got up and paced the floor of the darkened room in greatly disturbed spirit.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it,‚Äù he added a moment later, with firmness and decision. $I
be true to my name‚Äîit‚Äôs a ‚Äòdash away‚Äô for freedom. Yes, I‚Äôve made up my mind. I‚Äôm going to run away from ho$gf this can be called home.‚Äù
Old Warner had told Dave to go to his room and remain there until further orders. In his present state of mind, however,$ecared little for that. He was so excited$ the air of the close low-ceilinged roof room seemed stifling to him. The lad got out through the window and clambered down the remains of an old vine trellis without trouble. Too many times at night when he could not sleep had he stolen$úus secretly to work on his pet model in the barn loft, to miss his footing now. Dave reached the ground, went over to the pasture lot and threw himself down upon$Eass. His hands under his head, staring up at the stars, he rested and reflected.
The more he thought t$was he resolved to leave Brookville. He would leave it that night, too, he decided. He knew that when his guardian discovered his absence h$eraise a great hue and cry and try to find him, just as he had done before.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll move as soon as he goes to bed,‚Äù planned Dave. ‚ÄúThat will give me a safe start away from Brookville.‚Äù
Dave decided to regain his room by the route$∑left it. As he again neared the house, however, he noticed a light in the sitting room which his guardian usually occupied evenings$|Dave made out Silas Warner and observed what he was about, he glided to a thick bush near the open window and peered curiously through its branches.
Dave saw Mr.$éseated at the big cumbrous desk. He had thrown the sweater on the floor at his side. The pocket book lay open$3desk, and its contents were spread out before their engrossed possessor.
The old man was viewing the collection with gloating eyes. He took up the badge$ìweighted it in his hands as if thinking of it only as to its value as gold. For nearly ten minutes Dave watched his miserly guardian finger over the various articles. He knew that it was$Ømind to keep them if he could.
Finally old Warner restored all the articles to the pocket book. He took a small box from a drawer in the desk. Dave had seen it before. As$Äopened it, Dave again caught sight of the manilla envelope which he knew held papers referring to his dead father.
The old man locked up the desk and carried the box to a corner$èroom. Here he leaned over, and Dave saw him lift up a small section of the floor. When it was set back in place the box had disappeared.
A new trai$Qought came into Dave‚Äôs mind as he noticed all this. He now knew the secret hiding place of his miserly old guardian. He watched the latter take up$ighted candle and go over to the wing room of the house where he slept. Mr. Warner reached out of its window$_pulled in a rope, resting its end on the floor directly beside his bed.
This rope ran out to an old swing frame which held a bell of pretty good size. It had once belonged to a school house, but had got cracked, and Warner$	it for nothing. He had never had occasion to ring it. He had told his neighbors that he had put it up for protection. He was a lonely old man, he had said. Some one might try to rob him. If so, he could alarm$èand call them to the rescue. This had given rise$#	umor that the old man must have some hidden wealth about the place. To a stranger, however, the dilapidated old place would not indicate this.
Dave waited till his guardian had retired, then he got back to his room, moving$¨cautiously. Dave owned only the rather shabby suit he wore, but he had some handkerchiefs and the like,$se he gathered together and made up into a small parcel. Then he sat down to wait. It was in order for Dave to depart by the window route if he so chose, and no one$,ser. Dave, however, had something further to do before he left the inhospitable roof of his guardian.
It was not until two hours later that$á ventured to leave his room. He stowed the parcel containing his few small personal effects under his coat and took a piece of unlighted candle in his hand. Then he groped his way cautiously down the rickety stairs.
In a few minutes Dave was i$1sitting room. He had listened at the entrance to the wing room in which his guardian slept. He had heard Silas Warner breathing regularly, and was sure that he was asleep. Dave carefully closed the door of the $“ opening out into the hallway. He went $corner of the room where he had seen his guardian stow away the little box.
A chair stood over the spot, and this Dave moved out of place. He lit the candle, and by poking with his hand soon located a loose section$–flooring about two feet square.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve found it,‚Äù breathed Dave softly, and he lifted the square from its place.
Below showed the usual space found between beams. Lying across the lower boards was the box he was after. Dav$ë	it out. He found that it was secured with a small padlock.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to do it,‚Äù mused Dave, ‚Äúbut there is no other way.‚Äù
$	little difficulty in wrenching the padlock, hasp and all, out of place, for the fastening was of tin, and flimsy. Then Dave opened the cover of the box.
He took out the pocket book belonging to the aeronaut. Then he lifted$>	manilla envelope.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose there‚Äôs anything but old worthless papers in this$S	,‚Äù he decided, ‚Äúbut it belongs to me, if anybody. The mischief!‚Äù
Dave sprang to his feet in dismay. He had tilted the square of flooring against the chair near by. Some way accidentally$jhand had struck it, and it tipped over flat with quite a clang. Trying to stop it, Dave fell against the chair. This went$Xwith an echoing crash.
Dave knew that the windows were double locked. If he had disturbed old Warner, his only route of escape was through the single doorway of the room and down the hallway. So quickly did he run for the door that$ünot time to blow out the candle.
Dave opened the door with a violent push. Once out in the hall he glanced anxiously across it.
‚ÄúToo bad‚Äîtoo late,‚Äù he murmured, as his eye fell upon his guardian just coming out of his room. Agains$Ÿ light, Silas Warner must have recognized Dave. The latter was just stowing the manilla envelope in his pocket, and the old man$kseen that, too.
‚ÄúHi, there! Stop! What are you up to?‚Äù bellowed old Warner.
Dave ran down the hall at the top bent of his speed. He knew the kitchen door was bolted, and risked no chance of being stopped by halting to open it. Indeed, he dodged$†a step into a store room, the window of which was always open. He was through its sash space with a bolt and a squirm in a jiffy.
Making sure that he had lost nothing in his flight, Dave put across$¨yard. The last he saw of his alarmed and excited guardian was his frowsled grey head stuck through the buttery window, bawling frantically:
‚ÄúStop him! stop thief$‚Äù
Dave crossed the yard an$meadow in swift bounds. He was sorry that his intended flight had been discovered, and was satisfied that old Warner would proceed to make a great noise about it very promptly. However, now started on his runaway career, Dave resolv$Ühe would not turn back.
‚ÄúA good swift run, and I‚Äôll get safe and sound out of the neighborhood,‚Äù he told himself. ‚ÄúOf course Mr. Warner will start a chase after me, but$Äa lead they can‚Äôt beat. Hello!‚Äù
Dave Dashaway prepared for a new spurt of speed as a wild alarm rang out on the still night air.
Clang! $
CHAPTER IV

DAVE DASHAWAY‚ÄôS HIDEOUT
The old cracked school bell back at the Warner place awoke the echoes far and wide as Dave ran on. As he came to the corner of the road leading pas$qhome of his friend, Ned Towner, he paused for a moment to take breath and estimate the situation back$am.
The bell had by this time ceased its loud clangor. Dave saw lights appear beyond the house. He fancied, too, that he heard voices in the distance. It was not yet very late, and he guessed that, if only out of curiosity, some of the neighbors would$µar upon the scene.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs somebody coming from the other direction.‚Äù He spoke quickly, jumped the ditch, and plunged in among the clump of underbrush just in time to avoid three running forms hurrying dow$Œroad.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Bolger boys,‚Äù said Dave, peering forth from his covert.
‚ÄúHustle, fellows,‚Äù the oldest of the trio was urging.
‚ÄúYes, there‚Äôs some kind of a rumpus up at the Warner place,‚Äù added a second voice.
‚ÄúHope i$‡a fire,‚Äù piped in a third, reckless voice. ‚ÄúThat would make a regular celebration, after the airships.‚Äù
Dave, from what he overheard, judged that the Bolgers were on their way from the village when attracted by the commotion $RWarner farm. Others might soon appear, Dave mused, and struck out across a meadow. He knew that it would be risky to go into the village or nearer to it. In a very short time, thought Dave, his guardian$hhave the sheriff and his assistants looking for him.
The lad thought rapidly. He planned that if he could reach the switching yards of the railroad, he might get aboard some freight car and ride safely out$Jdistrict. He ran along a wide ditch which lined the Bolger farm, intending to leap it at a narrow part and cut thence across a patch of low land to$drailroad tracks.
‚ÄúO‚Äîoh!‚Äù suddenly ejaculated Dave, and fell flat, the breath nearly knocked out of his body.
He squirmed about, wincing with a severe pain in one ankl$vwondering what had tripped and still held him a prisoner.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trap,‚Äù said Dave, as he got to a sitting position and investigated. $Rmuskrat trap set by the Bolger boys, I guess.‚Äù
The blunt edges of the trap, which was secured by a chain to a stake driven into the ground, did not hurt him particularly. It was the severe wrench, the sudden stopping, that had caused$®ouble. Dave pried the trap loose and got to his feet.
‚ÄúHello, this is serious,‚Äù he spoke, as he found that he could not progress without limping, and then, only very slowly.
$´looked about him with some concern. The commotion in the direction of the Warner place was increasing. He fancied he heard the hoofs of a horse coming down the road.
‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt do to linger here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey would be sure to find me. I d$Kbelieve I can get to the railroad with this foot. I have certainly sprained my ankle.‚Äù
Dave had done nothing of$]kind, but he did not know it at the moment. The moon was shining full and high. He looked about him for some hiding place.
He limped along the edge of t$étch, despairing of being able to cross it. Suddenly a suggestive idea came to him as he made out the home of his friend, Ned.
‚ÄúIf I can manage to get to the barn on the Towner place, I know wher${de safe enough,‚Äù he mused.
His foot hurt him dreadfully, but he kept on, got past the rails of the pasture enclosure, and came up to the barn at the end away from the house and the road. The loft door was open$]leats ran up on the outside boards. Dave sunk down all in a heap in among the fresh sweet-smelling hay. The pain left him as soon as his weight was removed from his foot, but he was quite exhausted from the efforts he had made.
The boy rubbed$R	 ruefully and listened to distant sounds floating on the night air. Finally he crept over to the corner of the barn fartherest away from the opening leading to the lower floor. There was no danger of any one coming to that spot$4a broad crack in the boards there, and Dave could look out towards the road.
Dave caught sight of a horseman dashing along the highway$ydirection of the village. Then he made out the three Bolger boys returning to their home. A little later two men appeared. One$um was leading a horse.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mr. Warner and our nearest neighbor, and they‚Äôve got old Dobbin with them,‚Äù said Dave.
He saw his guardian go to the front of the Towner home. A light appeared inside, and in a few minutes Mr.$?came around the corner of the house with Mr. Warner. The horse was led up to the barn.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Dave has run away,$P,‚Äù Mr. Towner remarked.
‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôll catch him,‚Äù replied Dave‚Äôs guardian. ‚ÄúA bad boy, sir, a very$.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, I never thought that$!But he is. He broke into my desk, and has stolen money and other property of mine.‚Äù
The listening Dave fired up at this bold and false accusation. He was half minded to go down into the yar$Bce his accuser with the proof of the falsity of his charge.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll just let me take any old rig to hitch up Dobbin to, it$<be an accommodation,‚Äù went on Warner. ‚ÄúThat runaway rascal maliciously smashed the wheel of my only wagon this evening.‚Äù
Mr. Towner pulled a light vehicle out of a shed, and Dobbin was hitched up. Silas$± and his neighbor drove off, and Mr. Towner went back to bed.
Dave was worried and disturbed for a long time, even after things had quieted down. In his present crippled condition he did not dare venture outside. H$ïsnug and safe for the time being at least,$&finally he dropped off into a sound sleep.
The youth awoke to find the sun shining through the half-open hay door. He crept over to it as he fancied he heard some one moving about in the yard below. Dave was gratified$ü	his foot in much improved condition over the night previous. It was still a bit lame and stiff, but he could bear his weight upon it without flinching.
‚ÄúGlad the ankle isn‚Äôt sprained or broken,‚Äù he told himself cheerfully. ‚ÄúI believe I$çwalk with it, and maybe try a run, if I had to.‚Äù
He was much refreshed by his sleep, but both hungry and thirsty. His face brightened up considerably as he heard some one clucking in the chicken yard$Ωglancing down recognized Ned Towner.
Dave did not know who might be in the stable below or$vicinity. He leaned towards the loft door and gave a low but distinct whistle. It was one he and his chum used often in signalling one another.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù
Ned Towner dropped the pan out of which he was throwing corn to the chickens$·ooked about him in a startled way. Then he came out of the poultry yard, trying to locate the source$1call.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Dave,‚Äù the lurker in the hay loft heard him mutter. ‚ÄúNo one else‚ÄîDave.‚Äù
‚ÄúS‚Äîst!‚Äù
Dave had shown his face and waved his hand from the door aperture.
‚ÄúDave!‚Äù repeated Ned, in still further wonderment.
‚ÄúYes, i$Áme,‚Äù responded Dave in a hurried, cautious tone of voice. ‚ÄúAnybody else about?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot a soul.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll at breakfas$*	Yes.‚Äù
‚ÄúCome up here, will you?$You bet I will, and mighty glad to see you,‚Äù cried Ned, with vim$3sincerity. ‚ÄúNow then‚Äîwhat?‚Äù
Reaching the loft Ned challenged his friend, curious and excited, as if he expected that Dave would have a great story to tell.
‚ÄúYou know what has happened,‚Äù said$N.
‚ÄúThat you ran away last night‚Äîyes. They are talking about nothing else in the house yonder. Say, tell me$5it, for I know old Warner‚Äôs tale is all bosh.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe robbery end of it is, you can rely on that,‚Äù replied Dave, and he recited briefly his adventures and mis$since they had last met.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù cried Ned, when Dave had concluded his story, ‚Äúyou just stick to your plan.‚Äù
‚ÄúI intend to,‚Äù answered Dave sturdily.
‚ÄúIf ever you go back, or they get you back, life will just be unbearable$á. Old Warner has branded you as a thief, and he‚Äôs mean enough to keep the advantage. Tell me, how can I help you?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, of course I‚Äôm pretty hungry,‚Äù said Dave with a laugh.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll fix that end of it$9promised Ned. ‚ÄúJust wait till father and the hired men get off to work in the field, and I‚Äôll see that you get a first-class breakfast.‚Äù
Ned had to leave his friend just then, for some one was calling him from$≠ouse. A few minutes later Dave saw Mr. Towner and his hired men come to the stable, hitch up two teams$9drive over beyond the trees lining the yard.
In half-an-hour Ned came up through the inside of the barn. He produced a package done up in paper, a$Én took two bottles from his pockets.
‚ÄúHot coffee, cold water, biscuits, some bacon, gingerbread and two hard boiled eggs,‚Äù he reported.
‚ÄúWhy, this is just famous,‚Äù declared Dave with zest$†ere‚Äôs a book, too. Say, it will just suit your fancy,‚Äù added Ned, bringing the volume out from under his coat. ‚ÄúIt$ugreat story. I got it down at the library yesterda$(thought of you when I picked it out.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat is it called?‚Äù inquired Dave, his mouth full$Wgood food.
‚Äú‚ÄòModern Wonders of the Air‚Äô‚Äîup to date, too. It tells all about balloons and early airships. Too scientific for me, but I‚Äôll bet it will be easy as A. B. C. to you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about that,‚Äù said Dave, ‚Äúbu$Zright welcome. I‚Äôm thinking I had better keep hidden away for today, anyhow.‚Äù
‚ÄúI should say you had,‚Äù assented Ned forcibly. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äîbut I haven‚Äôt had a chance to tell you until n$s
What about?‚Äù
‚ÄúTwo of our hired men saw the sheriff and old Warner early this morning.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre they still looking for me?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe officers and your guardian were out till daylight, scurrying around the country in every direction. T$¬
‚Äôs men have driven to three or four neighboring towns. They are watching the railroad depot, and there isn‚Äôt a soul in town who$	on the lookout for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI suppose that Mr. Warner has made me out to be a regular boy villain,‚Äù suggested Dave,$qing serious.
‚ÄúHe has, but your friends know better. And soon as you are away safe and sure, I‚Äôll just make it my special business to face old Warner down with the real facts. You‚Äôre not thinking of leaving this hide-out in$Bdaytime, Dave?‚Äù
‚ÄúI dare not take the risk of being seen now.$2Then make yourself comfortable till I come home from school at noon,‚Äù said Ned.
Dave felt immensely better after his breakfast. He had a true friend to aid him and keep him posted, a safe hide-out, and an interesting book to read. $óstole down to the lower floor of the barn after a spell and took a dip in the water trough. Then he resumed his comfortable couch on the sweet-smelling hay, and for two hours was engrossed in reading.
With what he knew, and$	desired, and the way circumstances seemed to be leading him, Dave felt that he was destined to soon know a good deal more than he did about air sailing.
He got to planning his course of flight when he started out again. T$fell to dreaming, went to sleep, and had the delicious sensation of being aboard of a real airship, himself a full-fledged aviator.
CHAPTER V

MAKING OFF
‚ÄúNow is your chance, Dave.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, the coast looks clear$"How‚Äôs your foot?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat horse liniment from the stable has fixed it up all right. I think I could run as good as ever.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhich is mighty good‚Äîonly don‚Äôt run into any of the sheriff‚Äôs friends$SI‚Äôll try not to,‚Äù laughed Dave.
He was taking a farewell of his trusty and helpful friend, Ned. Dave had never known a truer one. He had kept under cover in the hayloft all that day. At noon time Ned had brought him a lunch and news. Ther$Õnot much to report. Mr. Warner had told the officers that his truant ward would make for some ‚Äúcrazy airship place,‚Äù first thing. The sheriff, however, refused to go outside the county, unless he was paid for it. Old$≈was too stingy to advance any money. So, it looked as though once beyond the boundaries of the immediate district, Dave would be pretty safe from pursuit.
It was almost dusk now, and the two friends stood just behi$êarn, shaking hands goodbye. Dave had eaten a good supper, and besides that Ned had brought a little parcel containing sandwiches, ‚Äúto spell‚Äù him, as he put it, if he got hungry on the all-night tramp he was starting out on.
‚ÄúI hate to see you$& out this way, without a cent of money,‚Äù said Ned rather anxiously. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got any, and you won‚Äôt let me tell mo$Fything about your being here. I know she would help you, if she could.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank$Ned,‚Äù replied Dave gratefully, ‚Äúyour mother too. You see, though, I have plenty of money,‚Äù and with a smile$bslapped his coat where the pocket book that had dropped from the airship the evening previous reposed.
‚ÄúYes, but$Lisn‚Äôt yours, Dave.‚Äù
‚ÄúI shall never forget that,‚Äù replied Dave promptly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just this, though. If I got in a tight place I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to borrow a dollar or two to help me on my way back to the owner$ÕYou‚Äôre going to look for Mr. King right off, are you, Dave?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, the birdman first and foremost, Ned. I‚Äôm counting a good deal on interesting him in giving me advice or help about getting into this airship business.$§Oh, you‚Äôll land there,‚Äù predicted Ned confidently. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too much in earnest not to succeed. Then y$2going to head for Fairfield?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, Ned.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the aero meet is?‚Äù
‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you afraid from what he guesses and knows, that old Warner will be looking for you, or have some on$" right at that place?‚Äù inquired Ned.
‚ÄúI shall guard out for that,‚Äù replied Dave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought and planned it all out.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow is that?‚Äù
‚ÄúTo-morr$e last day of the meet at Fairfield, so of course after that Mr. King won‚Äôt be there. I suppose he follows the circuit, as they call it. So, you see, I won‚Äôt be long$ì under any circumstances, and I don‚Äôt think my guardian will risk the money chasing me all around the circle.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so. I guess you‚Äôve figured it out about right, Dave. Well, good luck, old fellow, and be sure to write to m$	I will, Ned. Coast all clear?‚Äù
Ned glanced around the corner of the barn towards the house.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, Dave‚Äîgood-by.‚Äù
‚ÄúG$Ned stood watching his friend until he was sure he had got well across a pasture lot and safely out of view from the house or the road. This stretch of the Towner plac$Çvery poor land, finally running into a swamp. The moon was just coming up, but on the lowlands the rising mist was a protection to Dave.
He got to the end of the Bolger farm and then lined the drainage ditch extending beyond it. Dave leaped it$‰	at a narrow place, avoiding a wide morass. A little beyond this the lad came to a rutty road. It ran a mile or more to the railroad, but as he knew was not much used except to drive cattle to be shipped$Wstock pens at the freight yards.
Dave had his plans clearly worked out. His present proposed destination was Fairfield. He was in hopes of finding som$Ü
train making up in the yards. His idea was to get into some open or empty car, and secure a free ride most or all of the way to the city where the aero meet was in progress.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs$Ñne coming,‚Äù exclaimed Dave.
He had not counted upon meeting any one$that lonely road at $time of the night. With the words he sprang behind a big tree. Then he peered keenly ahead of him, intending to make for the fence and hide himself in the thick underbrush beyond it.
The air was clearer and the moonlight brighter o$Rhigher land Dave had now gained. Perhaps a quarter of a mile down the road he made out a horse. Chasing it was a man. The animal would browse and wait till its evident pursuer got up close to it$Nn with a snort, kicking up its heels madly, it described a series of playful circles, dodged the man, and leaped the fence at the side of the road, a yard-high wire.
Dave watch$V
 chase it all over a patch of scrubby brush. Finally the animal jumped the fence back into the road. It kept sideways towards its pursuer, nibbling at the grass. It waited till the man was fairly upon it. Then up went its heels, and along$î	 the animal sped,$man shouting vainly after it.
This time the horse took a longer spurt than before. Dave made out the situation, and debated with himself how he had better act. He could not afford to come up against any person who knew him. In the distance h$Pmake out the identity of the man. About the horse, however, Dave was surer. The animal Dave had certainly never seen before. No such horse was known about Brookville, and spontaneously Dave uttered the exclamation:
‚ÄúWhat a beauty!‚Äù
$∞	a lover of animals, and this one carried him to the bounds of admiration. High breeding, grace, elegance and value showed in the splendid animal. As it pranced up the roa$2	white moonlight, Dave was reminded of pictures he had seen of some magnificent charger.
‚ÄúHe looks like a race horse,‚Äù said Dave. $-has run away from that man, who is desperate to catch him. I ought to help him do it. If I can, I might tie the horse to a sapling and get out of sight before the man comes up.‚Äù
Dave kept behind the tree, his plan being to dash out when$Éran by, and attempt to catch the halter rope which was trailing on the ground. As the animal got within ten feet of the tree, however, it let down its speed to a slow walk$•, its pursuer fully a quarter of a mile away, proceeded calmly to nibble at the grass.
Dave kept perfectly still. The animal, all unsuspicious of his being so near, came closer and$to the tree in its browsing. A toss of its head sent the trailing halter rope whipping the ground not six inches from Dave‚Äôs foot.
‚ÄúGot you!‚Äù cried Dave in triumph, as he grabbed the rope with one hand, and with the other clung to a knob on$Ù	 to resist the quick jerk$horse gave. ‚ÄúSo‚Äîo, nice fellow, so‚Äîo.‚Äù
Dave talked soothingly to the animal, that, however, with flashing eyes and bristling mane, backed foot by foot, resenting capture. Dave got a hand-over-hand clutch on the rope and finally a firm grip$$halter bridle itself. He was surer of himself now, for he knew considerable about horses. Still he counted on something of a tussle. To hi$oprise, however, as he gently stroked the mane of the high mettled steed, the animal moved toward him and nosed down to his side, sniffing inquiringly.
‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù said Dave with an amused laugh, ‚Äú$|scents the lunch Ned gave me.‚Äù
Dave did not know what was contained in the package in his pocket, but he proceeded to break through its paper covering. His fingers closed on a sugar frosted cookie. As he brought it into sight the horse$Ÿan eager whinny and fairly snatched it from his hand. Then it rubbed its nose caressingly and coax$gainst his shoulder.
‚ÄúGood friends, eh‚Äîas long as the cookies last!‚Äù laughed Dave. ‚ÄúAll right, here‚Äôs another.‚Äù
Dave now had the animal under perfect control. Of a sudden, however, the horse pricked up$œears, glinted its eyes backwards, and began to paw the ground. Dave s$apparent owner of the horse approaching.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll stand my ground‚Äîthe man is a stranger,‚Äù thought Dave rapidly.
The man was puffing, panting and perspiring. He looked exhausted after his vigorous chase, but glad as he saw that Dave had$ﬂfirm and tight.
‚ÄúCapital!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have lost that horse for a fortune, and it means nearly that to get him safe back where he came from. Good for you, young fellow,‚Äù he add$ü‚Äôll make it a lucky catch for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúA good beginning in my runaway career,‚Äù said Dave to himself.
CHAPTER VI

CADMUS
‚ÄúLook out!‚Äù shoute$<suddenly.
In his eagerness to recover his horse, the man who had just come up to the scene of the capture ran directly$,animal to promptly retreat in some dismay.
Without trying to break away from Dave the horse began to move rapidly in a half circle, using tail, rear hoofs and body as a menace against the approach of its master. Dave g$åanimal another cookie, which quieted it down. However, the horse kept a constant eye on the man, who did not venture to approach any nearer.
‚ÄúWell, w$
‚Äù laughed the man in a comical way, ‚Äúthis is a new stunt for Cadmus. Why, I thought we were friends, old fellow,‚Äù he added, addressing the horse.
‚ÄúDid he run away from you?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúFirst chance he got‚Äîan$ÿonly one, so far.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow is that?‚Äù asked Dave curiously.
‚ÄúHe was raised a pet.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnybody can see that.‚Äù
‚ÄúNever heard of Cadmus?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot until you called him that,‚Äù replied Dave.
‚ÄúWell, Cadmus is a famous race$÷
e looks it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs made his name. Isn‚Äôt that so, beauty?$9Take care,‚Äù again warned Dave. ‚ÄúCadmus is still a little nervous.‚Äù
In fact the horse had resented any nearer approach of its master. Dave almost fancied tha$Sintelligent animal pressed up close to himself, as if asking protection.
‚ÄúThinks he‚Äôs going to get the whip for brea$@the rules,‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll discipline him on feed, but I never strike one of my horses. I say, youngster, you‚Äôve done me an immense favor. Will you carry it a little farther?‚Äù
$£
try,‚Äù replied Dave willingly.
‚ÄúIf you was going my way‚Äù‚Äîand the speaker nudged his shoulder down the road in the direction from which he had just come.
‚ÄúOh, any way suits me,‚Äù respond$∂quickly.
‚ÄúThen I wish you would lead the horse till we get to the car. Cadmus seems to have taken quite a fancy to you.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe belongs in a car?‚Äù asked Dave, a little vague$≠Why, yes,‚Äù replied the man, with a stare at Dave as if he supposed he knew that. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking Cadmus to Brompton. They switched us in the yards, and some one left the car door open, and$\made his break.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, I understand now,‚Äù said Dave quickly, and then an eager thought came into his mind, as he wondered if this lucky incident might lead $>finding a way out of Brookville unnoticed.
The last cookie in Dave‚Äôs hands kept Cadmus quiet and friendly until they reached the railroad yards. The man pilot$$way among a network of tracks, and finally along a string of freight cars standing beside a planked roadway.
‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù he reported.
Dave noticed that the man had halted$_
light colored car bearing the words: ‚ÄúPalace Horse Car.‚Äù A small$?	boy dressed in a horse jockey‚Äôs jacket, and a big husky fellow who looked like the hostler, were tilting a slanting platform up to the big door at one end of the car.
It took some persuasion to get Cadmus to go up this cleated$o	, but it was finally accomplished. Dave looked around the car with some admiration.
‚ÄúIt deserves its name, ‚ÄòPalace‚Äô, doesn‚Äôt it,‚Äù he asked of the owner$horse, who seemed greatly relieved to find the animal housed once more safe and sound.
‚ÄúYou ought to see the accommodations we have in a trip across the continent,‚Äù returned the horseman. ‚ÄúThis is nothing to it.‚Äù
$pretty fine, to my way of thinking,‚Äù declared Dave.
Fully one half of the car was given up to Cadmus. The box stall at one end was padded and cushioned to guard against jarring. The feed box was of porcelain, and the light blanket they put on$ï was as fine as a silk bedquilt.
‚ÄúCome in, youngster,‚Äù invited the horseman, when he had seen that Cadmus was attended to properly.
He led Dave into a partitioned-off apartment, comfortabl$µboudoir in the Pullman sleeper. There was a couch, a table and plush covered easy chairs. Into one of the$ Dave sank.
‚ÄúI calculated I‚Äôd have had some trouble in getting that horse if you hadn‚Äôt come along,‚Äù asserted the man.
‚ÄúOh, when Cadmus got through playing he woul$çbeen docile enough,‚Äù suggested Dave.
‚ÄúAnd made me miss railroad connections and a big race to-morrow,‚Äù added the horseman. ‚ÄúSee, here,‚Äù and he glanced into a pocket book he had taken out, and then drew a long slim book$ïfountain pen from another pocket, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù hesitated Dave, ‚Äúwhat do you want to know for?‚Äù
‚ÄúI want to give you a check.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat$2To fix you out for your trouble.‚Äù
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know where to cash it,‚Äù declared Dave. ‚ÄúBesides, if you want to fix me out, as you call it, there‚Äôs another way that would please me better.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust name it, youngs$This car goes to Brompton you told me, I think?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, we start in about an hour.$&Well, sir,‚Äù observed Dave, ‚Äúif you will give me a free ride that far, I will consider that you have paid me a hundred times over for the little I‚Äôve done for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúLittle you$$me?‚Äù cried the horseman. ‚ÄúI suppose you don‚Äôt consider that Cadmus is just about worth his weight in gold to me. Now, see here,‚Äù an$Äman took the pocket book out again and drew forth two bills. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs all the currency I‚Äôve got with me‚Äîtwo fives. You‚Äôll take them.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, sir,‚Äù began Dave.
‚Äú$5, I said,‚Äù repeated the man in a forceful way. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôll give me your name and address, and promise that if ever you need a frie$Ssend word to Amos Baker. Here‚Äôs my card.‚Äù
Money and card were thrust on Dave in spite of himself.
‚ÄúMy name is$(Dashaway,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I have no address, and don‚Äôt know how soon I may have.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, is that so?‚Äù observed the horseman, eyeing his companion curiously.
‚ÄúYes, sir. The truth is I‚Äôm leaving home in a hurry‚Äîbut$Åcannot interest you.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, it will,‚Äù echoed the horseman. ‚ÄúTell us all about it, lad. Maybe I can give you some advice that will help you out.‚Äù
Dave told his story, and his auditor listened to$¨th great attention.
‚ÄúI like your pluck, and your plan to get to Fairfield is all right,‚Äù said the horseman. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be at Brompton in three hours. You‚Äôve now got money enough to carry you$Üand a good deal farther. Your going to Brompton is carrying you directly out of your route, you can ride as far as that, though, get off there and take the first train for Fairfield, see?‚Äù
‚ÄúI shall never forget all$ãkindness, Mr. Baker,‚Äù said Dave gratefully.
Just as a locomotive hitched onto the train of which the stock car was a part$s called in the colored boy. He gave him some orders, and in a few minutes quite a repast was spread out on the table from several hampers$Ç	ar.
The train reached Brompton after midnight. Mr. Baker shook hands heartily with Dave.
‚ÄúI reckon nobody will be hanging around looking for you at this time of night,‚Äù he observed. ‚ÄúGood luck to you, youngster. If you have any further trouble$¨that pesky guardian of yours, drop me a line and I‚Äôll appear on the scene. Write occasionally, anyhow.$8be glad to hear how you are getting along. If some mean people don‚Äôt interfere, it will be in a good way, for you‚Äôre the right kind of a boy to make a success, Dave Dashaway, and Amos Baker says it.‚Äù
The freight train had stopped at a crossing$Has it moved on Dave had to walk down the tracks nearly one-half a mile to reach the railroad depot.
Dave trudg$ehopefully to meet his first experience in a big city.
CHAPTER VII

ROBBED
‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs the hardest part of it over and done with,‚Äù declared Dave, as he walked into$Orailroad depot at Brompton.
The youth felt pretty much encouraged. His foot had mended, he had earned ten dollars, and had won a good friend. H$6got safely away from Brookville by a route his pursuers would never suspect him of taking.
‚ÄúMore than all, best of all,‚Äù spoke Dave with longing and satisfaction, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm well started for Fairfield and the airships.‚Äù
Dave fou$depot almost deserted. A few travelers were nodding on the benches in the passengers room, waiting for a late local train going north. The ticket office was closed, but the depot policeman was on duty. Dave approached this official.
‚ÄúWhat about a$Öfor Fairfield?‚Äù he spoke.
‚ÄúLast one gone two hours ago.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen is the next train?$8:15 A. M.‚Äù
Dave was disappointed. That was nearly a third of a day ahead. It would be a long wait, but he decided to make the best of it. He selected a snug seat in a dark corner and began to nod before he was aware$U
‚ÄúHere, rout out,‚Äù sounded a gruff voice in his ear, and he was shaken rudely.
‚ÄúOh‚Äîyes, I was asleep,‚Äù mumbled Dave, recognizing the depot policeman.
‚ÄúGoing to close up. No more trains either way to-nigh$∆he said.
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm waiting for the Fairfield train.‚Äù
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do it here. Against the rules. Come back in the morning.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere can I go?$	y, to a hotel, of course. There‚Äôs lots of them within a stone‚Äôs throw.‚Äù
Dave got to his feet and out$B depot. He had unexpectedly received a great deal more money than it would take to get him to Fairfield$atreasured his little hoard, though. The idea of saving the price of a night‚Äôs lodging had pleased him.
‚ÄúWhat do I care for a bed,‚Äù he told himself as he came out of the depot into the starry$. ‚ÄúI can sleep anywhere,‚Äù and Dave made for the deep entrance to a store and sat down upon its step. Almost instantly, however, a policeman in uniform stepped out of$z
shadow of a neighboring doorway, on the lookout for stragglers.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to move on, sonny,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù assented Dave with a comical smile. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt hurt those iron steps, though.‚Äù
$Malked on till he came to a big building. It bore the sign: ‚ÄúEmpire Hotel.‚Äù Glancing in at the lobby with its elegant appointments Dave shrugged his shoulders and w$ß.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too rich for my blood, even if I do feel like a millionaire,‚Äù he smiled. ‚ÄúSomething more modest$[e.‚Äù
Finally Dave reached a respectable appearing hotel that looked second class and cheap. He entered the lobby and went up to the clerk‚Äôs desk.
‚ÄúHow much do you charge for a night‚Äôs lodging?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúFifty cents$‚‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll stay, then.‚Äù
‚ÄúGot any baggage?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, sir$&Any references?‚Äù
‚ÄúI should say not!‚Äù Dave told himself, and he walked away when the clerk had explained that they never took in transients without baggage or an introduction from a responsible party.
$£sauntered about leisurely now. He made up his mind to walk$1all night. At the end of an hour, however,$unfamiliar stone pavements began to remind him of his weak ankle. He noticed an illuminated sign running out from a shabby looking building. It read: ‚ÄúRooms‚Äîtwenty-five and fifty cents.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat sounds all right,‚Äù reflected Dave,$Ahe ascended a stairway lighted up by a smoking oil lamp at its top.
A drowsy, sleepy-eyed young man was lounging in a broken chair behind a desk. A$Zside were a lot of pigeon holes, and some holding keys.
‚ÄúI want to stay here all night,‚Äù stated Dave.
‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs hindering you, is there?‚Äù observed the young man. ‚ÄúWhat price?‚Äù
‚ÄúTwenty-five cents.‚Äù
T$: ran his eye over a portion of the pigeon holes and announced:
‚ÄúSingle rooms at that price all gone.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd the best room is fifty cents?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got it$?That‚Äôs too much.‚Äù
‚ÄúBetter go to Tom‚Äôs Lodging House,‚Äù sneered the fellow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find a fine ten-cent crowd there, if t$Öyour style. Tell you, if you don‚Äôt mind sharing a room with a boy like yourself I can accommodate you.‚Äù
‚ÄúTwo beds?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes$I‚Äôll take it.‚Äù
‚ÄúPay$Dave drew out his money. The young man grumbled at having to change a five dollar but that was soon got through with. Then he handed Dave a key with an iron strip to it, that prevented lodgers from putting it in their pockets and forgett$∑return it.
‚ÄúRoom 58, fourth floor,‚Äù advised the young man, and lounged back into his chair again. ‚ÄúBe sure to put out your light when you go to bed.‚Äù
Dave climbed up two more flights of rickety stairs. The air of the place was close. One$ÿ was divided up into as many as a hundred little bunks, and the snoring$Gsturbing.
‚ÄúI wish I hadn‚Äôt come here,‚Äù thought Dave, but he kept on to the fourth floor, made out 58 on a door, and unlocked it and entered a room with one window.
The light in the hall showed a lamp on a table. There were two narrow beds$Aroom, and they did not look particularly uncomfortable. When he lighted the lamp, Dave glanced over at the cot that was occupied.
Near it was a chair, and over this hung some shabby garments. Dave had a plain view of the sleeping inmate$bed, and he did not like the face at all. It had a red scar on one cheek, the hair was straggling and untidy, and, taken altogether$;boy made Dave think of a crowd of young roughs who had run up against him and tried to provoke him into a quarrel in his early midnight wanderings.
Dave opened the window of the room to let in fresh air, then he undressed. He drew a chair$¥s bed and folded his clothes across it. Then he blew out the light.
‚ÄúFeels good to stretch out human like once more, sure enough,‚Äù said Dave contentedly.
Then he groped about on the chair until he found his coat and dr$¨pocket book belonging to Robert King, Aviator.
‚ÄúI want to make sure of that,‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúMy own money, too. I‚Äôll quietly put it all in the $ìand slip it under my pillow. Then no one can play any tricks on me without waking me up.‚Äù
Dave worked in the dark. He fished out the bills from his pocket$Åhe got hold of the silver change he had received down stairs. It was composed mainly of dimes and nickles. Just as he was striving noiselessly to transfer the handful to the pocket book, bang! rattle! tap! went half a dozen rolling$Ü out of his hand.
‚ÄúHello, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù challenged a sharp suspicious voice, and Dave knew that the noise made by the falling coins had awakened the sleeper in the other bed.
Dave was bound to answer. He slipp$Cpocket book under his pillow, and held tightly the coins remaining in his hand to prevent them from jingling together.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me,‚Äù he replied.
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs me?‚Äù
‚ÄúRoomer‚Äîjust come in.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a boy, aren‚Äôt you$ALike yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?$I did not register,‚Äù replied Dave evasively.
‚ÄúHumph! don‚Äôt want to be sociable, eh? Well, shut up, then.‚Äù
With a grunt the occupant of the other cot seemed to flounce over and resume his slumbers. Dave$–	like the sound of his voice any better than he had the look$-face. He hoped the fellow had not heard the coins drop on the floor. Dave reached out cautiously, groped about, managed to locate several nickels, plac$ãse noiselessly in the pocket book, and was glad that things had quieted down.
Somehow he felt disturbed and uneasy. He knew$Le place was second class, and probably housed a good many rough characters. He made up his mind that he would keep awake until daylight, then go back to the railroad depot. He heard two and$5three o‚Äôclock strike from some neighboring bell tower. By four$;he was fast asleep.
In a dreamy sort of a daze, his next waking action was lying with his eyes closed and counting seven strokes$\bell.
‚ÄúOh, dear, this won‚Äôt do at all,‚Äù cried Dave, leaping from the bed to the floor. ‚ÄúWhy, I‚Äôll miss the train to Fairfield if I d$umove sharp. Hello‚Äîhello!‚Äù
Dave came to a standstill, posed like$tue. He stared at the chair by the side of the bed. His clothes were gone!
He rubbed his eyes and looked again. In their stead, lying scattered carelessly on the floor, were the$z	belonging to his boy room mate.
In a second a dreadful flash of dismay and fear came to Dave‚Äôs mind. He sprang at the bed he had just left$Flifted the pillow quickly.
‚ÄúGone! All gone!‚Äù he gasped turning cold all over. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been robbed!‚Äù
CHAPTER VIII

A STARTLING SURPRISE
Dave ran to the door, his heart sinking, and alive with the keenest excitement. Arriv$‡re, he checked himself. He realized that he could not rush out in the shape he was in.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it!‚Äù he cried resentfully, as his eyes fell upo$Xclothes left in place of his own. ‚ÄúOh, this is terrible!‚Äù
A little faint and a good deal dismayed, the youth sat down on the edg$p	bed to get a better grasp of the situation. He saw now that he was probably too late to overtake$Dthief. His eyes fell upon two nickels lying on the floor near the cot. These had been a sort of a guide to the robber, who must have heard them jangle to$kwhen Dave accidentally dropped them.
‚ÄúThat fellow must be a real bad one,‚Äù mused Dave. ‚ÄúHe probably pretended to be asleep all the time, and was watching me! Anyhow, he has manag$Gget hold of everything I had. The worst of it is the watch and the money$
edal belonging to Mr. King are gone too. The thief may have been gone from here for hours, for all I know. I‚Äôm in a bad fix.‚Äù
Dave felt very rueful. He had not come up against much of the wickedness$	orld before this. He blamed himself for not guarding his possessions more carefully,$1coming to the lodging house at all.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing for it but to put on these clothes,‚Äù he decided at last, with a sigh. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose it will do any good to tell$®keeper about the thief, and in a big, strange city there is little chance of my running him down.‚Äù
The clothes of the boy who had robbed Dave very nearly fitted him. Dave‚Äôs own attire had been threadbare in spots, but it$%
clean. Somehow, Dave could not repress a feeling of repugnance as he put on the clothes. The shoes pinched, being short and narrow, but he managed to get them on.
Dave went down stairs and into the office$Ñsecond floor of the building. A lot of loungers were sitting around on benches and a new clerk was behind the desk.
‚ÄúIs the young man here who was on duty last night?‚Äù inquired Dave, returning the room key$_ just relieved him,‚Äù was the reply. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone home to sleep.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe gave me room 58,‚Äù went on Dave. ‚ÄúThere was a boy in one of the beds. These clothes are his$i
y?‚Äù ejaculated the man, with a stare.
‚ÄúYes, sir. He‚Äôs taken mine. I shouldn‚Äôt think you would allow such characters in here.‚Äù
The man shrugged his$Sers indifferently. He pointed to a sign behind the desk. It informed roomers that the house was not responsible for thefts.
‚ÄúIf you had anything valuable in your clothes,‚Äù advised the man, ‚Äúyou should have left it in our safe.‚Äù
The speaker$‚ to a box with a padlock behind him. Dave decided that he could place little reliance in either the man or his strong box.
‚ÄúI did lose something valuable,‚Äù he cried, smarting unde$Nlost.
‚ÄúDid, eh?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir‚Äîfifty dollars in money, beside other valuables.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat so?‚Äù smiled the man incredulously. ‚ÄúKnow the thief?‚Äù
‚ÄúI do. Don‚Äôt I tell you that he slept in the same room with me?‚Äù
‚ÄúKnow him again$]
am sure I would.‚Äù
‚ÄúCan you describe him?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, he had a scar on one cheek$CBetter put the police on his track, then.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôll do just that,‚Äù replied Dave with energy, starting briskly for the door unde$impetus of the suggestion.
Dave hurried from the building and down the street. At a crossing he found an officer in uniform. This man directed him to the nearest station. Dave framed in his mind the most accurate description he could give$Áthief.
‚ÄúIt hadn‚Äôt ought to be very hard to trace down a fellow with a scarred face like that,‚Äù meditated Dave. ‚ÄúHello! I never th$sof it before.‚Äù
With the words ‚ÄúPolice Station‚Äù staring him in the face from$ront of a grim looking brick building, Dave came to a dead halt with a shock.
It had just occurred to him that he might invite considerable risk by visiting the police. They would want to know how h$úby the pocket book of Robert King. He would have to tell them the circumstances and his name. They might have received some word already from Brookville to look out for him$Pget to inquiring into his story and detain him as a runaway.
‚ÄúNo, it won‚Äôt do at all,‚Äù declared the boy emphatically.
He got away from the place as fast as he could, all stirred up$found time to realize that he was still near enough to Brookville to be seen and recognized by some one who might inform on him. Dave went back to the railroad depot and consulted some maps a$º	ables.
He found that Fairfield was not on the direct line, and that the indirect route covered about sixty miles. If he could go back past Brookville in the other direction it would be ten miles less. Across country on foot, as nearly as$y
make it out, on air line route it was not over thirty-five miles.
‚ÄúWhy, I could walk it in a day,‚Äù thought Dave‚Äî‚Äúand I‚Äôll do it!‚Äù
He had just ten cents in his pocket‚Äîthe two nickels the thief had disdained to pick up. $Zmade up his mind that it would be a waste of time to try and hunt up the boy who had robbed him. In the first place, Dave was unfamiliar with the city. The thief had probably got away from it with his booty as fast as he could.
Dave walked across$i	. Near its limits he went into a bakery and invested the ten cents in crackers and buns. The shoe$Qore began to hurt his feet. After a brief lunch he struck off on a smooth country road.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my duty$`reach Fairfield and find this Mr. King,‚Äù he decided. ‚ÄúI suppose he values that medal very highly. He is in better shape than I am to start a search for the thief or the plunder.‚Äù
A little after noon Dave sat down by a$%stream and took off his shoes. They had hurt him terribly the last mile he had traveled. He found his feet blistered and swollen, bathed them in the cool water, and when he resumed his tramp walked barefooted, carrying the shoes strung over$›ulder.
Shortly afterwards Dave reached a little village. As he passed a cobbler‚Äôs shop he went in and asked the man in charge if he would exchange his shoes for anything he could wear. The shoemaker$mover a lot of stock uncalled for, but there was nothing among them that would fit Dave. Finally he made a bargain to take twenty-five cents for his shoes, and resumed his journey.
It$ãabout four o‚Äôclock in the afternoon when Dave met with a new adventure. It had more influence on his future career than he dreamed of at the time.
He had followed a path leading along a ravine. Its edges were heavily wooded, and$_bottom a pretty babbling brook coursed its way. Dave was glad to get once more where things were green. He lay down on the grass, fell asleep, and awoke from his nap with the echoes of a seri$sharp reports ringing in his ears.
‚ÄúHello! some one shooting,‚Äù exclaimed Dave. ‚ÄúOh, the mischief!‚Äù
He had traced$sounds as coming from the valley, and had crept to the edge of the ravine and leaned far over in an effort to peer past the thick foliage. The crumbling edge gave way under the weight of his bod$£Dave took a tumble.
He grabbed out at some bushes, but they gave way, only briefly slowing down his progress.
Then as he whirled along he was conscious that$rolling directly towards a towering bronzed figure, standing like a statue on a ledge of rock.
The form was that of an Indian, remarkable and start$êin this unexpected place. He stood posed magnificently, an uplifted tomahawk in his hand, and not ten feet distant on another ledge of rock was a man dressed in hunter‚Äôs costume. This latter person had a rifle$áwas sighting along its barrel, and on the other side of the ravine, seated under a tree conversing with a young lady, was another man.
In the flashing$ì he had of all this, it looked to Dave as though the hunter was going to shoot the man with the lady, unless the Indian hurled his tomahawk in time to prevent him.
Straight up against$KDave rolled. Quickly the latter put out his foot. He brought it squarely down on Dave‚Äôs chest and held him motionless.
‚ÄúLie still,‚Äù he spoke rapidly, ‚Äúor you‚Äôll spoil the picture!‚Äù
CHAPTER IX

MAKING HIS WAY
$‹felt as if he was in some unreal, topsy-turvy dream. Everything was like a Wild West picture, and he closed his eyes wondering if his fall and roll down the side of the ravine had not sent his wits astray.
The fling$6tomahawk he saw was real, so was the sharp report of the gun. Above all, the heavy foot pressing down on his body and holding him motionless was tangible.
Dave opened his eyes $ífoot was suddenly removed, to view an amazing spectacle. The ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù had taken out a pipe and was leisurely filling it$D	hunter‚Äù had picked up the ‚Äútomahawk‚Äù, which had struck a piece of rock and split open, showing that it was made of papier mache. Across the ravine the young man had risen to his feet and was yawning and stretching, and$Hlady walked away putting up her parasol.
‚ÄúMind yourself, now,‚Äù spoke the owner of the foot that held Dave a prisoner, and he reached down, grasped the boy by the arm and set him on his feet.
‚ÄúI say!‚Äù gaspe$nvaguely‚Äî‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù
‚ÄúMoving picture,‚Äù replied the man briefly.
‚ÄúYes, it moved quick enough$;said Dave slowly. ‚ÄúOh, I see now,‚Äù he added, as, a step advanced, he came in view of several persons near two automobiles down the valley, and in their midst a camera.
It was all plain to Dave in a moment. The$u	he saw were acting out a motion picture. He had heard of these groups before. In the present instance they had selected a pretty natural spot as a framework for their$õ. Dave had stumbled upon them at a moment when a particularly thrilling drama was in progress.
‚ÄúCome on with us,‚Äù spoke the man who had played the Indian, looking$•over curiously. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have lunch, and if you‚Äôll carry my traps down to the camp you shall$Fa snack.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù replied Dave, greatly interested in the group, and nothing loth to accepting the invitation.
The man had motioned to a spot under a near tree where a satchel lay. It was open and he closed it, but not before$» saw that it was filled with his acting wardrobe.
Dave followed after the two men. They soon reached the first automobile. Here a man, apparently the chauffeur and general utility$2was placing food on a piece of canvas spread on the ground as a tablecloth.
Nobody paid any attention to Dave, who set down the satchel as directed. The chauffeur had a large, well-filled hamper beside a tree stump which served for$™. Dave went up to him.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt I help you, mister?‚Äù he asked pleasantly.
‚ÄúWhy, yes, you can,‚Äù was the prompt response. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty rushing around here when$?eople get hungry.‚Äù
Dave under direction set seven wooden plates and as many paper napkins on the impromptu table. He sliced up two long loaves of bread, carried the cold meat and fruit to the$U, and went to a spring nearby to fill a big tin pail with cool, sparkling water.
A young man wearing glasses$lsmart looking and brisk, seemed to be the manager. He beckoned Dave and the chauffeur to join the family party.$1enjoyed the liberal meal immensely. He was interested and entertained with the continuous chatter of the group about him.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the programme, Mr. Alden?‚Äù ask$°big fellow who had acted the Indian.
The man addressed took a roll of manuscript out of his pocket. He separa$Xsheets and passed one around to each of the party.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your parts,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúScenario: ‚ÄòThe Ruined Mill‚Äô.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any mill,‚Äù observed the man who had play$hunter, looking up and down the ravine.
‚ÄúTwo miles farther on, according to my directions,‚Äù explained the leader of the party, consulting his note book.
Dave was so interested that he plann$would linger with the group till he had seen how they made a moving picture film. When one of the crowd whom$<called Davis moved away from the table and went to the intricate outfit near the wagon, Dave unobtrusively followed him. He was engrossed in watching the process of ‚Äúloading up‚Äù the film reels, when the manager came up.
‚ÄúSee here,$Ê,‚Äù he said in his jerky, energetic way, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to get busy if we expect to cover the programme in daylight.‚Äù
‚ÄúI told you that myself,‚Äù was the retort.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve waited two hours for Banks now.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got delayed someh$"
The only bother is the rescue of the heroine in the mill race.‚Äù
‚ÄúCut that act out, then.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs the thriller of the scene. No, I can‚Äôt do that. Non$à	fellows can swim, though, and I don‚Äôt see what we are going to do.‚Äù
Dave fancied he understood the situation. In an eager way he pressed forward.
‚ÄúMr. Alden,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúca$ìI be of some help to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúHey, what?‚Äù exclaimed the man, looking Dave over. ‚ÄúA boy? But then‚Äîlook here, can you swim$hLike a fish.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll do. Why, this is big luck. Hi, Dollinger, start up the machines. It‚Äôs wasting time waiting for Banks any longer.‚Äù
Dave got into the smaller automobile after the traps lying about had been packed$Hit. The others boarded the larger and more elegant machine. They went a roundabout way to strike a traversed road, and in about an hour came to the stream again.
It was where an old abandoned mill stood. Mr. Alden gave Dave one of the acts$‚ÄúScenario‚Äù, as he called it. He explained to Dave what$(was to do.
‚ÄúPut on this suit,‚Äù directed the manager, selecting some clothing from a big box. ‚ÄúBetter wear a wig and whiskers, so you‚Äôll look more like a man. These moccasins will fit your feet. Now, you understand, when$∏villain pushes the heroine into the mill stream, you are to act your part. Just follow the cues in$#typewritten screed there.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù reported Dave promptly, ‚ÄúI think I know what you wish me to do$VIt was like watching a play, the various scenes that were enacted inside and outside of the old mill, all forming part of a very interesting story. As it neared its end, Dave took a fishing rod, as directed, and seated himself on the bank$östream a few yards from the mill.
At the sound of a whistle he glanced at$2	, arose, dropped his fishing pole, tore off his coat, and took a plunge into the water, throwing his arms up in the air and floating down the swiftly rolling stream. The heroine came$;
into view.
She splashed around and seemed about to sink as Dave reached her. He caught her, swam for the shore, and both went off to change their dripping attire.
‚ÄúYou did that very well,‚Äù said Mr. Alden in a kindly tone, coming up to$¥some minutes later. ‚ÄúYou can keep those moccasins if you like,‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúAnd here‚Äôs your pay for helping us.‚Äù
The speaker handed Dave a dollar bill. There had been considerable of a fascination to the little business part$]had played. He would not have been sorry if Mr. Alden had offered him continued employment. The latter forgot him in a moment, however, bustling about and directing the others, who piled into the big automobile.
‚ÄúYou had better wait here$_	 hour, Dollinger,‚Äù he spoke to the man who attended to the rough work of the party.
‚ÄúAll right, sir.‚Äù
‚ÄúBanks may come along. If he does, fetch him on to Fairfield.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that!‚Äù said Dave with sharp interest to$ﬁ
. ‚ÄúIs the party going to Fairfield?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs next on the route, I understand,‚Äù answered Dollinger.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù broke in Dave eagerly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you could crowd me into your machine and take me that far$æWhy not?‚Äù quizzed Dollinger, good naturedly.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you double work, if you could,‚Äù persisted Dave.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where you‚Äôre headed for, is it?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell,$8
welcome to a seat in the machine. I like your company,‚Äù observed Dollinger cheeringly.
Both of them bustled about getting the traps of the party stowed into the most convenient compass. After that$Ñwaited an additional hour for the man Mr. Alden expected.
‚ÄúI reckon we‚Äôve filled orders,‚Äù said Dollinger finally. ‚ÄúIt looks like rain, and if we$i to reach Fairfield before dark we had better make a move.‚Äù
A storm overtook them ten miles on their way. They were, however, then on a good road, and found shelter in a wayside shed. There was still further delay when the auto broke down$Jdeep rut. Dollinger had to send Dave on to the near village to bring a repair man to the scene.
It was about dusk when they started again. While the man was making repairs$¢and Dave ate their supper.
‚ÄúThere are the lights of Fairfield, I guess,‚Äù spoke Dollinger, as they drove down a well ballasted road. ‚ÄúMr. Alden and his people have gone to a hotel, and I will$!to call on him for directions as to where I am to put up. I generally rough it this fine weather.‚Äù
The rain had ceased, but a fierce wind was blowing, the sky was overcast, and altogether it was a disagreeable evening. Dollinger located the hotel$’Mr. Alden was stopping. He went in and shortly came out with a card in his hand.
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù he reported, ‚ÄúI know where to go to.‚Äù
Dave‚Äôs plans were half forme$h	mind. He was delighted to realize that he had reached Fairfield so readily‚Äîthat, too, he congratulated himself, with comfortable footwear and over a dollar in his pocket. Of course his first thought was of Mr. King, the airman. Dave reflected,$5, that a dark night in a strange town was not a condition favoring a search for$9
r. He was pretty well tired out, and he kept with Dollinger, hoping something might turn up that would give him a free bed for the night.
$X	 ran the automobile quite out of the city. Finally he lined the fence of some kind of an enclosure. Dave noticed that it was of considerable extent, but in the dark, he could not make out exactly w$S
.
They at length reached a wide gateway. Outside of it was a small building resembling a switchman‚Äôs shanty. There was a light in$Wand an old man moving about.
Dollinger stopped the automobile, leaped out and knocked at the door of the building. He showed the card to the man inside who read it, seemed to give some directions to $™	, and then came out and unlocked the gate.
He $it shut again when the automobile had entered the enclosure. Dollinger drove across an open space, reversed, and backed into one of a series of low sheds with the front$Rand exposed to wind and weather.
‚ÄúNow then,‚Äù he said to Dave, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre housed for the night. Want to stay with me?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt will save me the price of a lodging somewhere else,‚Äù explained Dave.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve earned a sure one her$7declared Dollinger. ‚ÄúNothing like the pure open air for health. I‚Äôll rig you up a shakedown that will please you, I‚Äôll guarantee.‚Äù
$Ç	 was as good as his word. He spread blankets over the roomy seats of the automobile, and Dave voted he had never welcomed a more pleasant resting place.
Dave slept like a top. It$≤broad daylight when he awoke. For a moment he forgot where he was. Just as he arose Dave gave a jump, a gasp and a cry.
Gazing out through the open front of the shed$Rsaw a dazzling object cavorting swiftly above the ground.
‚ÄúAn airship!‚Äù shouted Dave Dashaway in a transport of delight.
CHAPTER X

AT THE HANGARS
‚ÄúHello there, what‚Äôs struck you?‚Äù cried Dollinger.
The chauffeur and general utility man of$Àmoving picture combination dropped a big spoon with which he was stirring something in a pan outside of the shed. Near by was a tripod$Xan oil lamp burning under it. Dave$stood that Dollinger was preparing breakfast.
Dave did not reply. He could not, at just that moment. It seemed to him as though at the touch of a magician‚Äôs wand his whole life had been changed‚Äîas if the most ardent desires of his heart$>
granted.
The day previous, if some genii had promised to gratify one special wish, Dave would have asked to be put among just such airships and in the company of$)men. Now all that he had desired was before him.
Circling majestically aloft was a big biplane. Way over at the end of$closure was an elevated apparatus, from which an airship of another typ$Aevidently making a trial ascent. The machine rose only a few yards, described a half circle, and had to be hoisted up again and again.
Between it and the sheds were several small buildings, and at least two of these held some kind of air craf$‘one in flight finally enchained the entire attention of Dave. He watched it till it had made a score of dizzying manoeuvres, and returned to the ground at the far end of$äclosure as graceful as a bird and as easily as if landing on springs.
‚ÄúSets you dreaming, does it?‚Äù demanded Dollinger with a grin, slapping Dave on the shoulder to wake him up.
‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just glorious!‚Äù cried Dave,$gsparkling eyes. ‚ÄúMr. Dollinger, what place is this?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, the aero park, of course.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean where they have had the big meet?‚Äù inquired Dave breathlessly.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it$hOh, my‚Äîand I‚Äôve got in, too!‚Äù cried Dave in a dazzled sort of way.
‚ÄúWhy, yes,‚Äù replied Dollinger, ‚Äúthough that don‚Äôt count for much just now. You see, nothing‚Äôs going on.‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing going on$≤, gazing at the airship aloft and then across the broad field beyond him.
‚ÄúI mean as a show. The meet closed yesterday.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut all thos$~	s?‚Äù
‚ÄúMost of them will move over to Dayton, where they have another meet next week.$UI hope Mr. King has not got away yet,‚Äù Dave said to himself.
‚ÄúCome on, get a hot cup of coffee and some warmed-up pork and beans into you, and you can go back to your wonder staring, if you like,‚Äù$ùDollinger.
He had arranged a fine breakfast from his stores. Dave felt a sense of gratitude and satisfaction as he realized his novel and pleasant situation.
‚ÄúEverything is turning out just as I hoped it would,‚Äù$hflected. ‚ÄúIf only I hadn‚Äôt lost that pocket book, and if Mr. Warner doesn‚Äôt get track of me.‚Äù
Dave insisted on helping Dollinger clean up and pack away the things used for breakfast.
‚ÄúAre you going to stay here for awhile, Mr.$n
?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúOh, yes, all day, I understand,‚Äù replied Dollinger. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the exact orders until Mr. Alden comes along. He told me, thoug$Üterday that we wouldn‚Äôt make any further move till to-morrow. Why do you ask, lad?‚Äù
‚ÄúI wanted to look about a bit.‚Äù
‚ÄúGo straight ahead,‚Äù directed Dollinger heartily. ‚ÄúSay,‚Äù he added, with a droll grin, ‚Äúthinking of sticking to us$§Who wouldn‚Äôt!‚Äù cried Dave‚Äî‚Äúthe way you treat folks.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre mighty welcome company,‚Äù declared Dollinger in a friendly way. ‚ÄúWilling and useful, too. I sh$≠	 wonder if Mr. Alden could find a place for you with the party.‚Äù
Dave did not commit himself by making a direct reply. His heart was set on airships, and he ardently hoped there would be some chan$°him in that field.
‚ÄúIf I fail, I can fall back on the moving picture crowd,‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúI really like the business.‚Äù
Dave left the automobile with the zest and eagerness of a boy starting out to see a big show for the first time. He headed$ far corner of the grounds where animated scenes were in progress. Just then, however, a broad low-wheeled wagon to which two horses were attached came along. It was seemingly conveying a large-sized monoplane out$ for repairs. Dave noticed that the machine was somewhat battered up.
He had never been so near to an airship before, and he followed the wagon in a sort of fascinated way. Once he reached out his hand and touched one wing of$¬. It positively made his finger tips thrill. When it reached the big gates of the enclosure, the same old man who had admitt$Bautomobile the evening previous opened them for wagon and airship to pass out.
There were several people bustling around the little building near the gate which was the office of the grounds. One brisk individual seemed to b$◊manager. Dave, standing around full of everything that was going on, noticed$this man was arranging affairs for departing airmen. A lank poorly-dressed boy stopped the man as he was called to the office.
‚ÄúSay, Mister, can you tell me where I‚Äôll find $±?‚Äù
The boy held out a crumpled soiled card, at which the manager glanced quickly and then brushed by, saying:
‚ÄúMr. King? You‚Äôll find him down at the hangars.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs them, now?‚Äù stared the boy. ‚ÄúDo you know?‚Äù he inquired turning$≠ upon Dave, who stood at his elbow.
‚ÄúI declare I don‚Äôt,‚Äù replied Dave with a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the word in print, and I know it refers to some part of the grounds here, but$Ü
 exactly understand it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got to find out.$see this Mr. King.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs he the airship man?‚Äù asked Dave.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him. Say, where ar$@hangars?‚Äù persisted the lad, addressing the old gate keeper.
‚ÄúWhy, down there, of course,‚Äù was the reply, and the speaker pointed to the buildings at the other end of the field, where the airships were housed.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you$ßat way,‚Äù said Dave, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù replied his companion.
Dave wondered what the awkward countrified youth was doing on the aviation field, an$Hbusiness he could have with Mr. King. He decided that this was his chance to meet the man whom he had traveled so far to see.
Dave‚Äôs companion did not explain his mission. He acted and walked like a fagged out person who ha$Nhad much sleep or a great deal to eat for some time. He was dusty and travel worn, and made Dave think of a raw country bumpkin starting out in life to find$swork other than that of the farm. He had an innocent, credulous face, but showed a certain doughty spirit, as if he was very much in earnest as to what$'about and intended to stick to it.
There was a good deal stirring around the hangars. Everything was airships and airmen. Over beyo$= some of the machines were in action. Dave‚Äôs companion kept on asking about Mr. King, and at length his search was rewarded.
He came finally to a portable tarred canvas house. One end of it held a monoplane, which both boys reg$m with interest through the half open door. Near an$
 at the other end of$building an old man was potter$round with a pail and a brush. Dave‚Äôs companion ran up to him.
‚ÄúSay, Mister,‚Äù he bolted out in his usual unceremonious way, ‚ÄúI want to see Mr. King.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, you do, eh?‚Äù retorted the crabbed old fellow. ‚ÄúWell$9sit down on that bench yonder and wait your turn, will you?‚Äù
Dave and his companion did as the man directed. The boy looked sharply at Dave.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù he observed, ‚Äúyou going to stay here and wait, too?‚Äù
Dave nodded an assent${anxious.
‚ÄúGot business with Mr. King?‚Äù he inquired.
‚ÄúWhy, yes,‚Äù replied Dave. ‚ÄúHe lost something, and I want to tell him about it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs it,‚Äù spoke the boy with a great sigh of relief. ‚ÄúI was afraid you$ter a job. If you was, I got here first.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, you can see Mr. King$&,‚Äù said Dave. ‚ÄúSome one is with him now.‚Äù
The walls of the frail canvas structure were thin. Sounds readily penetrated to the outside air. Two persons seemed to be in the room beyond the open door. One$ñm was speaking now. These words fell upon the hearing of the two listeners.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better give Jerry another chance, Mr. King.‚Äù
‚ÄúA$ ?‚Äù shouted a deep angry voice. ‚ÄúIf your boy ever comes around here again I‚Äôll horsewhip him within an inch of his life, Mr. Dawson, and I want you to make yourself scarce, too!‚Äù
CHAPTER XI

THE AIR KING
‚ÄúYou$ãbe awful sorry for this,‚Äù Dave and his companion heard next.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, Dawson.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy boy, Jerry, knows this business, and you won‚Äôt find a lot who do$MI tell you that will do,‚Äù was the forcible response, ‚Äúand it ends it. Your son gave away a lot of information to a competitor. There are things missing, too.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you call Jerry a thief!$&If he isn‚Äôt that, at least he neglected to watch my property and my interests as he was paid to do.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll suffer for sending my son away with a bad character!‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me see him again, that‚Äôs all$vHuh!‚Äù
The last speaker, a big fierce-looking man came out through the doorway with the word. From the way he was dressed Dave decided that$!employed somewhere about the grounds. His face was red and his fists clenched. He gritted his teeth viciously as he went on his way.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my turn now,‚Äù spoke up Dave‚Äôs companion eagerly.
He made a quick bolt through the doorway. Dav$ƒleft alone. His eyes followed the man whom he had heard called Dawson. The latter had gone about a hundred feet down the hangar row, when a boy about the age and size of Dave came suddenly into view from behind a shed, where evidently$¿been waiting.
Dave decided that this must be the son of Dawson concerning whom there had been such an animated discussion. He could surmise from their looks and gestures$èe father was reporting the result of the interview to his son. The latter scowled forcibly. Then he shook his fist in the direction of the hangar.
‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù said Dave thoughtfully, ‚Äúthere must be a vacancy here. Maybe I have arrived ju$~
nick of time.‚Äù
It was easy to figure out that the boy, Jerry Dawson, had been discharged from the employ of Mr. King. His father had interceded for him, but it had been of no avail. Suddenly Dave‚Äôs interest was distract$áincident of the moment. He heard his late companion speaking beyond the doorway:‚Äî
‚ÄúYes, sir, a man gave me that card and said he had heard that you was in need of a boy.‚Äù
‚ÄúH‚Äôm, yes,‚Äù Dav$≠Mr. King reply. ‚ÄúThat is true, but‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your name.‚Äù
‚ÄúHiram Dobbs$Where do you come from, Hiram?‚Äù
‚ÄúI did live twenty miles west of here, but I got tired of farming and my brother said I could try something else if I wanted to. I worked for a fellow in the merry-go-round business$city till night before last. He sloped without paying me.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you want to break into the aero business, eh?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I heard there might be a chance with you, so I came here. You see, I‚Äôve had some experienc$£	In the airship line?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, no‚Äîballoons.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow? Where?‚Äù asked Mr. King.
‚ÄúDown at Talcott, the town near our farm. There was a circus and a balloon ascension. I got caught in a rope and was dragged thirty feet up into$Â.‚Äù
‚ÄúIndeed?$Yes. Here, there‚Äôs a slip from the Talcott Herald, telling all about ‚Äòthe daring feat of our young townsman.‚Äô If I hadn‚Äôt caught in a tree I‚Äôd have gone further.‚Äù
There was a sound of rustling paper. Then Dave heard Mr. King laugh. It$Bkindly, good natured laugh, though. Dave voted he would like the man in whom he was so interested yet$	had never seen.
‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù spoke Mr. King, ‚Äúyou were quite a hero. Being pulled up into the clouds on a balloon anchor is not$&kind of experience that counts for much in the airship line, though, my lad. If I had something just suited to you, I would give you a chance on your honest face. Frankly$o
I do not think you would be of much use to me until you have had some practical experience.‚Äù
‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù replied Hiram Dobbs in a subdued tone, ‚Äúfor I like you, mister. Now, where can I get that$x?‚Äù
‚ÄúBy working around the hangars and doing odd jobs till you know a monoplane from a biplane, and a pylon from an aileron. See here, you go down to the office of the grounds‚Äîknow where it is$≈Yes, sir, near the big gateway, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. You ask for Mr. Linden, and tell him I want him to give you a job. T$'ill be down to see him about it in an hour or so.‚Äù
‚ÄúWill he put me at something?$#I think he will. He has the concessions at all the meets for food supplies and the like. That$S bring you in touch with every angle of the aeroplane business, and you look like a boy who would learn.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust try me and see!‚Äù chuckled Hiram. ‚ÄúThank you, sir, I‚Äôll get directly about this$ì	.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait a minute‚Äîgot any money?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, sir, I haven‚Äôt$AThere‚Äôs a dollar.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not begging, sir,‚Äù dissented Hiram. ‚ÄúIf I get work‚Äî‚Äî$MYou can hand it back pay day.‚Äù
Hiram came out with dancing eyes. He jumped up in the air, cracking his heels together. Then, out of sheer jubilation, he slapped Dave on the shoulder.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a job!‚Äù he cried$"	m very glad you have,‚Äù responded Dave heartily.
Hiram did not wait for any further talk. He started on a mad dash for the other end of the grounds. A man was coming around the corner$3little building, and Hiram very nearly ran into him. Dave had got up from the bench to venture upon seeing Mr. King, when the newcomer preceded him through the doorway$tconsidered that he was entitled to the next interview with the airman. The latest arrival, however, was so forcible and precipitate$yDave patiently resigned his chance.
The newcomer was very much excited. He was an old man, smart looking, but$9fat and fussy. Dave heard him break out in a stirring tone with the words:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs come, Mr. King.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, you mean‚Äîah, yes,‚Äù replied the airman, ‚Äúyour parachute suit?$MYes, a perfect full-sized one. See here, you know what I want. You said you were very much interested in my patent.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the truth, Mr. Dixon.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd that you would give it a trial.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will, later$πmy friend, I am engaged all day to-day.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, the meet is over?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, but I have a contract for a private exhibition. There‚Äôs good money in it, and I can‚Äôt disappoint my people$òHow‚Äôs the next day?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to go to the Dayton grounds to get ready for the opening day at that meet. Tell you, Mr. Dixon, bring your device up to Dayton, and I‚Äôll see what I can do for you.$∑ am anxious to make a practical test right away.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of the fellows here who will help you out.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, and$qblunder, and queer my whole business. No, sir! The man who won the endurance prize is t$'for me, and your recommendation would be worth more to me than that of any ten men in the aviation line.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you make the trial yourself, Mr. Dixon?‚Äù inquired the airman.
‚ÄúOh, yes!‚Äù laugh$#old inventor, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be a fine performer with my clumsy bungling in an airship and my two hundred pounds, wouldn‚Äôt I!‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so. You had better pick out a lightweight for the first trial.$NWhere will I find one?‚Äù spoke Mr. Dixon in a musing tone. ‚ÄúYou see, I don‚Äôt expect a long drop on the first test. You know Boisan never ran his biplane without wearing his padded helmet. All that can do, though, is to break$~shock of a fall. My parachute isn‚Äôt on the pad order at all, nor to prevent$E‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat does it do, then?‚Äù asked Mr. King.
‚ÄúIt reduces the rate of the drop and land$wearer safe and sound. The suit is a loose flowing garment fitted to a framework carried on the back. The lower ends are secured to the ankles. When the aviator throws out his arms, the$á	spreads out like an umbrella. I am satisfied if you once see my parachute dress work, you will give a good word for it that will make it a success.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, Mr. Dixon,‚Äù replied the airman, ‚Äú$òare anxious to have a trial on the field here, I‚Äôll find some one to give it a show, under my direction. I hardly know where I will get my man, but I can probably pick him up somewhere about$¢
. It‚Äôs a risky experiment, though.‚Äù
Dave Dashaway arose from the bench. Afterwards he wondered at his audacity, but just at that moment he could not resist the quick impulse$2seized him.
He stepped through the doorway and turning past a half partition, faced the two men whose overheard conversation had so interest$à‚ÄúMr. King,‚Äù he said taking off his cap, and his heart beating rapidly at his own temerity, ‚ÄúI would like to try that experiment.‚Äù
CHAPTER XII

A NEW FRIEND
‚ÄúWhy, who are you?‚Äù exclaimed $√.
Dave stood somewhat awed at being in the presence of the famous aeronaut for the first time. He was embarrass$Whis own boldness. Yet he managed to blurt out:
‚ÄúI have been trying to get to you for two days.‚Äù
Mr. King stared at Dave in a wondering way. He looked him over from head to foot.$?was not disappointed in the impression made upon him by the aviator. Mr. King was a man with a keen, clean-cut face and well-knit frame. There was a look of decision and business in his clear eye. As he smiled, t$J
lso a genial, indulgent expression to his lips that won Dave.
‚ÄúOh, I think I understand,‚Äù spoke Mr. King slowly. ‚ÄúI suppose you are another applicant for a job. Heard I‚Äôd fired my assistant and all that. I didn‚Äôt$òthat news had traveled so fast and far.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, no, sir,‚Äù said Dave quickly. ‚ÄúI knew nothing about what you speak of until a few minutes ago$mThen‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI have been seeking you to find out if you lost some property out of an airship near Brookville, about sixty miles from here, three nights ago.$ñEh, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù cried the airman, starting up into an attitude of attention and surprise.
‚ÄúThere was a sweater,‚Äù continued Dave, ‚Äúand a pocket book with fifty dollars in it, and a watch and a medal.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat about it‚Äîw$?‚Äù demanded Mr. King quite excitedly. ‚ÄúThe medal, I mean. The rest of the stuff doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid you lose what I said, sir?‚Äù asked Dave.
‚ÄúYes, yes!‚Äù
‚ÄúNear Brookville?‚Äù
‚ÄúI sailed ove$  the night you tell about,‚Äù replied the airman. ‚ÄúI miss$sweater that I had rolled my valuables in just as I got back here. Of course I didn‚Äôt know exactly where I lost it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Dave, ‚ÄúI found it‚Äî‚Äî$.Good!‚Äù
‚ÄúI started to bring it to you, for I saw your name on the medal, and had heard all about you.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen you‚Äôve got$@have you?‚Äù asked Mr. King eagerly and expectantly, starting up from his chair.
‚ÄúI am sorry to say I haven‚Äôt,$`	,‚Äù replied Dave regretfully. ‚ÄúI started for here to return the property to you and lost it.‚Äù
‚ÄúLost it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat is, I was robbed.‚Äù
‚ÄúBy whom?‚Äù
‚ÄúA boy in a lodging house where I stayed night before las$|	But you know the thief?‚Äù
‚ÄúOnly by description,‚Äù replied Dave.
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äô$Pinform the police?‚Äù
Dave paled slightly, and then flushed up. The airman was eyeing him keenly$"old inventor looked suspicious, too.
‚ÄúMr. King,‚Äù at length spoke Dave, ‚ÄúI am a runaway from home.‚Äù
‚ÄúHum!‚Äù commented Mr. Dixon dryly.
‚ÄúI had to run $I,‚Äù continued Dave desperately. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story. There‚Äôs a heap to tell, but I‚Äôm afraid it wouldn‚Äôt interest you, sir. When I found myself robbed, I thought the best thing to do was to come and tell you all I could.$èwfully sorry I was so careless.‚Äù
‚ÄúSee here,‚Äù interrupted Mr. King, in a generous way, placing a reassuring hand on Dave‚Äôs shoulder, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say that again. You‚Äôve done all you could, and I thank you for it. Mr. Dixon$∑he went on, glancing at his watch, ‚ÄúI am going to have a mighty busy morning, and I want you to excuse me for a while.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù nodded the inventor, though rather glumly, aris$èis feet.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be around the field all day, and be glad to see you and talk to you about trying your invention any time after noon.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs good,‚Äù bowed Mr. Dixon, brightening up. Then he fixed his eye on Dave$¥said: ‚ÄúI believe this young man made some remark about helping us out, when he first appeared on the scene.‚Äù
‚ÄúSay, you‚Äôre a regular old ogre, Dixon!‚Äù railed the airman. ‚ÄúYou look as hungry as one, wanting to mak$Œlad your first victim. I shan‚Äôt recommend anybody, nor furnish$ to try your parachute dress, until I am perfectly satisfied he won‚Äôt come to any harm.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen you do, Mr. King,‚Äù broke in Dave, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a chance to show my confidence in you by trying the umbrella suit$ÄAll right. I‚Äôm to see you after dinner,‚Äù said the old inventor leaving the room.
‚ÄúNow then, my lad,‚Äù spoke the aviator briskly, ‚Äúsit down. I want to talk to you.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù replied Dave gladly.
‚Äú$Byou to tell me your whole story. I have an idea it is going to interest me. First, your name?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Dave Dashaway.‚Äù
‚Äú$?‚Äù repeated Mr. King, with a slight start and a look in his eyes as though he was searching his memory.
‚ÄúYes, sir, my father was a professional balloonist. Maybe you have heard of him.‚Äù
‚ÄúH$!‚Äù cried the aviator, with new interest. ‚ÄúI should say I have. And read of him. Why, he was a pioneer in advanced aeronautics. And you are his son?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir.$Tell me all about it.‚Äù
Dave looked into the kindly, sympathetic eyes of his new acquaintance feeling sure that he had found a true friend. He told the story$Xlife simply. As he tried to make it brief, his auditor more than once checked him as if every detail interest$".
‚ÄúYou are a brave, deserving young fellow, Dashaway,‚Äù said the airman heartily. ‚ÄúI have you to thank for putting me on the track of that lost medal, which I value beyond price.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo$bhink there is any chance of your getting it back?‚Äù inquired Dave anxiously.
‚ÄúI am sure of it. I want you to come with me down to the field office. In the meantime think up the closest description possible of$Oellow who stole it. Here,‚Äù added the airman pointing to a little writing table. ‚ÄúJust sit down there and jot $as clear and brief as you can.‚Äù
Dave did as directed, while Mr. King explained:
‚ÄúThe thief won‚Äôt value the medal. He will probably sell that$äthe watch for what they are worth as gold. I intend to telegraph to the police at Brompton to keep an eye out for the thief and to offer a reward$$	medal.‚Äù
Mr. King bustled about the room, and put on another coat and took some papers from a satchel, and acted as if$]o start out on business.
‚ÄúWhy, I was just going to the hotel to see you,‚Äù he said suddenly, as a newcomer appeared on the scene. ‚ÄúReady for$É	?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù was the prompt reply, and the latest visitor stepped into the room where Dave sat. ‚ÄúWhy, hello‚Äîfriend of yours, Mr. King$êWhat, do you know young Dashaway?‚Äù
‚ÄúVery pleasantly, too,‚Äù answered Mr. Alden, the manager of the moving picture outfit, for Dave recognized him at once as that person. ‚ÄúHe helped us out of a tight box yesterday.$ªYou didn‚Äôt tell me about that, Dashaway,‚Äù remarked the aviator.
‚ÄúThere was so much else to tell,‚Äù explained Dave.
‚ÄúW$proceeded the motion picture man, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking of you, my lad. How would you like to work for me right along?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù broke in Mr. King, in his quick, jerky way. ‚ÄúNo, you can‚Äôt have him.$aEh?‚Äù questioned Alden, with a stare, ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm thinking of hiring him myself,‚Äù replied the aviator.
CHAPTER XIII

A START IN BUSINESS
Dave Dashaway trembled$ûexcitement and pleasure. He was proud and glad the way things had turned out. The aviator notice$3happy look on his face, and nodded encouragingly.
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù spoke Mr. Alden. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôve got first show. Trouble is, our man we depended on, a fellow named Banks, failed us yesterday$≠I guess he won‚Äôt show up in time for the airship pictures. He is the only one in our crowd who will do what we call the desperate stunts.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you call those?‚Äù inquired$èman.
‚ÄúOh, Banks is a regular acrobat. He‚Äôs the man who falls down stairs and gets knocked around in the funny pictures, and jumps from the seaside cliff or is blown up by dynamite$Stragic ones.‚Äù
‚ÄúI see$Now, like yesterday. The hero had to rescue the drowning heroine in the roaring mill stream. Our young friend here happened along$Anick of time, and did the stunt nobly. None of the rest$crowd could even swim‚Äîthis young fellow can, like a fish.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd now you expect him to fly?$%Hardly that,‚Äù was the laughing rejoinder, ‚Äúbut in your exhibition we want to bring in the usual little incidents to make an interesting story, you know, and Getaway here‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúYou mean Dashaway.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, he could work in famousl$&	Well, we will see about it,‚Äù said Mr. King. ‚ÄúHow would you want to begin the pictures?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe outfit will be here inside of an hour.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will be on hand,‚Äù promised the aviator. ‚ÄúCome with me, Dashaway. I$ú	get that telegram to the city.‚Äù
Dave felt as if he was treading on air. It was in fact the supreme moment of his young life. He did not feel$ãhe had done any grand things, but telling the truth and doing his level best had put him in line with very promising prospects.
Mr. King hurried along$6his brisk, bustling way, absorbed in the business on his mind. When they reached the office of the grounds, he beckoned Dave to follow him into the little compartment that answered for a telegraph$p.
‚ÄúGive me the description you wrote out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGood for you, Dashaway$'added with satisfaction, as he ran his eye over the words Dave had written. ‚ÄúYou cover it well. With that tell-tale scar o$[face, I think the young rascal who robbed you will be easy to find. All I care for, though, is the medal. He will probably sell that and the watch to some pawnbroker, and a liberal reward will lead the police$ñ them for me.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy losing those things is going to cost you a lot of money, Mr. King,‚Äù said Dave regretfully.
‚ÄúAnd supp$_at sweater of mine had been found by some dishonest person, or trampled down out of sight in the mud? No, no, Dashaway, I count it a big thing, you‚Äôre giving me my first hope of recovering$bedal.‚Äù
Mr. King wrote out a lengthy telegram, ordering it sent, left some instructions with the operator, and went outside again.
Here he was immediately surrounded by half a dozen persons. Among them were newspaper reporters seek$≥nformation as to the aviator‚Äôs plans for the next coming aero meet at Dayton. Professional airmen wanted to discuss the programme ahead. Some agents with airship supplies took up some of his time. It was half an hour before Mr. King got rid$9company. Then he came up to Dave, his watch in his hand.
‚ÄúSee here, Dashaway,‚Äù he spoke, ‚ÄúI want to ask you a question.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù replied Dave attentively.
‚ÄúDo you$S	go to work for me?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo I!‚Äî‚Äù faltered Dave. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been my dream ever since I heard of you.$TGood enough. You‚Äôre engaged. Go down to the hangars and wait till I come. Hold on,‚Äù halting Dave, as he started to obey orders. ‚ÄúI want to say a word. I call it all opportunity,$équeer way you have run into my affairs. I like your make up. The last assistant I had played me mean. He‚Äôll lose by it. I‚Äôm willing to do a good deal for a fellow who will be loyal to his busines$¢put big faith in you. Don‚Äôt disappoint me.‚Äù
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù began Dave in a great gulp, and he could not bring the words out, he was so worked up.
‚ÄúI know what you would s$xspoke the airman quickly. ‚ÄúNever feel any different about it than you do at this moment, and there will be no regrets.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one thing troubles me, Mr. King,‚Äù observed Dave.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?$ZMy guardian. I ran away from home.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood for you. From what you tell me, that miserly old rascal, Warner, won‚Äôt waste any time or money hunting you up. If he does, I think I know how to handle him$™Dave started down the field so filled with joy that he could have shouted out aloud. Up to this time his mind had been so occupied with affairs outside of airships,$v	had found no opportunity to view those he had seen in detail. Now he seemed to be a part of the great unique activity surrounding him on every side.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful, i$grand!‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúOh, to think of my luck! And the friends I‚Äôve met with!‚Äù
Dave‚Äôs eyes filled$ grateful tears. He felt as if suddenly he had found his right place in life and a real home. The thought that he was to see, survey and perhaps handle$Gairship thrilled him with gladness.
‚ÄúIt will be like getting into some palace of wonders,‚Äù he reflected, ‚Äúand the grand chance to learn from$star man of them all, Mr. King.‚Äù
Dave hurried by many a group surrounding aeroplane models that would have halted him usually. He was anxious to get to the hangars. He had not yet examined the crack mon$}belonging to his employer. He knew its name, the Aegis, and had got a mere glimpse at$3outlines. Now he was free to look it all over.
‚ÄúHold on there!‚Äù
To make a short cut to the hangars, Dave had passed between a part of$/grandstand and a building where refreshments had been sold during full attendance at the meet. There were not many people around just there, and this short cut took Dave into a still more lonely space.
Some one had come up behind him, butted$Hhim forcibly, and sent him up against a wooden platform.
‚ÄúI want to speak to you,‚Äù sounded a voice strange to Dave$?You‚Äôve got a nice way of introducing yourself,‚Äù began Dave, turning around with some asperity. ‚ÄúHello, I know you.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo? Then there‚Äôs no need of any explanations$~jeered his assailant.
Dave recognized the latter instantly. It was Jerry Dawson, the boy whose father had visited Mr. King less than two hours previously. $Öhad seen this youth only once before. It had been at a distance, too. He knew that sullen, scowling face, however, at$].
The boy was taller and older than Dave. He was stockily built, and strong. He stood with his fists raised, blocking Dave in against the platform.
‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù demanded the latter.
‚ÄúI want to ask you a question.‚Äù
‚ÄúAsk away$Have you gone to work for King?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat if I have?‚Äù
‚ÄúThen you‚Äôve landed in the wrong box, I can tell you that. I‚Äôll stand no fellow cutting in on my rights.$àdo you call your rights?‚Äù inquired Dave calmly.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked for King ever since the season began. I‚Äôve slaved for him and helped him get the endurance prize.‚Äù
‚ÄúIndeed?‚Äù remark$útrying to suppress a smile.
‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs in a muff. He knows he can‚Äôt get along without me, but$@stubborn, and so am I. You leave him alone, and don‚Äôt cut in on my job, or I‚Äôll make it warm for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you expect I‚Äôm going to do?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúHas King hired you?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre$T
start in with him?‚Äù
‚ÄúI am.‚Äù
‚ÄúAfter what I tell you?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, that won‚Äôt make any difference,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôm going to whip you.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt take a warning.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot from$GLook out!‚Äù
Dave determined to defend himself. He was no match for the big overgrown bully, but he was cornered, and it$Ft in his nature to show the white feather on any occasion.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bigger than I,‚Äù said Dave, backing to a firmer footing, ‚Äúbut I won‚Äôt let you or anybody else browbeat me without cause.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm$éeither of you!‚Äù roared an intruding voice. ‚ÄúYou young bully, make yourself scarce, or I‚Äôll pick you up by the nape$rr neck and drop you into that mud puddle over yonder!‚Äù
CHAPTER XIV

HIS FIRST AIRSHIP RIDE
Dave recognized the newcomer on the scene as Hiram Dobbs, his companion during his first visit $¶e hangars. The latter had appeared like magic through a near open doorway of the temporary restaurant building.
Hiram had said he was bigger than Jerry Dawson. He now proved that$4also stronger. He grasped the surprised bully by the arm, gave him a swing, and sent him slamming up against the side of the nearest building.
‚ÄúGet out of here,‚Äù he ordered, ‚Äúor I‚Äôll run you out.‚Äù
The discomfit$∑	scowled frightfully at Dave‚Äôs champion. He made a move to seize a brick and hurl it. Then he changed his mind as Hiram started on a run for him.
‚ÄúTher$Äa bully for you,‚Äù announced the country boy, stooping to pick up a little box he had placed on the ground when he ran to Dave‚Äôs rescue. ‚ÄúGood thing I just happened around.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, he acted pretty vicious,‚Äù replied Dave. ‚ÄúH$mmad because he‚Äôs lost his place, and wants to scare me off from taking it.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you let him do$!I won‚Äôt.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo you got a job with Mr. King?‚Äù questioned Hiram, his face lengthening a trifle.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answered Dave. ‚ÄúYou see‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smarter than me? yes. A blind owl could see that. And I‚Äôm right glad of it,‚Äù add$∑ heartily. ‚ÄúSome day I‚Äôll hit it just as lucky. Oh, say,‚Äù and Hiram grinned drol$OYou tell Mr. King that I know what a biplane is now.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo you, indeed?$Yes, and the difference between a pylon and aileron. And a lot of other things. And I‚Äôm going to learn a heap more,‚Äù declared Hiram confidently.
‚ÄúThen you‚Äôve begun your education already, have you?‚Äù$< man Mr. King sent me to hired me right on the spot. There isn‚Äôt much to do here, but I‚Äôm to go with his crew to Dayton, and so all around the circuit. Six dollars a week, and keep and commission.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat doing?$Helping in the restaurant and peddling novelties. I can‚Äôt be idle, so I‚Äôm trying to start an honest penny rolling among the stragglers around the grounds,‚Äù and Hiram tappe$!box under his arm.
‚ÄúWhat have you got there?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúSouvenirs,‚Äù explained Hiram, opening the cover of the box and displaying a lot of pins and buttons bearing or stamped with miniature airships.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do,‚Äù decla$∂ heartily, ‚Äúand thank you for sending that Dawson fellow about his business.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right, and you look out for him. He‚Äôll do you some mischief if he can.‚Äù
Dave went on his way with a word of good cheer to Hiram. He felt$æthey were bound soon to meet again, and prized the manly qualities of this new acquaintance. As he near$;hangars two automobiles flashed past him.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù cried Dave, ‚Äúin that first one is my friend Dollinger, with the camera man and his traps. Mr. Alden‚Äôs group are in the second machine.‚Äù
Dave reached Mr. King‚Äôs quarters to find$Bautomobile halted there. The other one, guided by Dollinger, he noticed had driven over to a clear stretch at the far end of the grounds.
‚ÄúMotion pictures, of course,‚Äù thought Dave, and just then the man who had ac$Ã Indian in the motion scene of the day previous recognized him.
‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he hailed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on time. Going to help us out to-day?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I hope so,‚Äù replied Dave, and he returned the friendly nods of the lady and other$	party.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting for Mr. Alden,‚Äù explained the man who had first spoken to Dave.
‚ÄúI think he expects to be here soon, with Mr. King,‚Äù said$D Then he moved around to the part of$building where the airship was housed as he saw a man in overalls pottering about$Copen doors.
‚ÄúSaw you with Mr. King,‚Äù said the man as Dave came up. ‚ÄúGoing to work for him?‚Äù
‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù answered Dave.
‚ÄúWell, you look a likely one. Seen much of airships?‚Äù
‚ÄúAlmost nothing, until this morning,‚Äù repli$r I‚Äôll show you the last word in aerial construction when I introduce you to the Aegis,‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúHere,$rgive you a look at the beauty.‚Äù
Dave moved as gingerly about the machine as if it were made of porcelain. His companion pointed $G
in features of the splendid piece of mechanism.
Dave heaved a great sigh as he came out from the exhibition. He was fairly fascinated with what he had seen and$ad been explained to him.
Mr. King and the motion picture manager came up a minute later. They talked together. Then $[	got into the automobile with the others.
‚ÄúAll oiled up and ready, Mason?‚Äù he called out to the caretaker of the hangars.
‚ÄúAll ready, Mr. King.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen run her down to where you see that$∂. Dashaway will give you some help.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt seems just like a dream, all this,‚Äù ruminated Dave, as he assisted Mason in propelling the monoplane down the course.
The sky was clear, with a moderate breeze, the day cool and bright. For the time,$ö forgot all the past, and a rare golden future seemed spreading out before him.
Soon$IAegis was in place where the aviator wanted it. Dave listened with interest to the talk of the motion picture man. He soon understood that they were to take a series of$Cs bringing in something of a story.
‚ÄúWe will work in all our interiors at our city studio,‚Äù explained the manager. ‚ÄúWhat we want to do here first, is to picture out‚Äîhere it is,‚Äù an$Vspeaker read over his scenario‚Äî‚Äú‚Äòscene in prison yard. Convict at the rock pile.‚Äô‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù announced the man who had acted the hunter‚Äôs part the day before.
‚ÄúGet in trim, then,‚Äù order$[
ager.
The actor went behind one of the automobiles where there was a large wardrobe trunk. In a minute or two he reappeared arrayed as the typical convict.
The camera man had produced from his properties various needed articles. When the$[ was posed, he sat with a hammer in his hand breaking stones on a rock heap.
‚ÄúMiss Mowbeay,‚Äù spoke the manager. ‚Äú‚ÄòVeiled lady in black.‚Äô‚Äù
‚ÄúAll ready.‚Äù
‚Äú‚ÄòVisit of the Convict‚Äôs Wife$<Wher‚Äîrr‚Äîr! went the camera, and the actress advanced to where the convict was at work. A prison guard kept near her. A$hend of the interview the wife secretly dropped a folded note on the stone heap.
‚ÄúWe are ready for you, Mr. King,‚Äù next spoke the motion picture man. ‚ÄúFlight of the Airship.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do?‚Äù asked$t
 going up to his machine.
‚ÄúOh, about five minutes thrilling stunts. Then I want you to swoop down near the convict. You drop him a rope‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúHold on, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù cried the aviator.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt work out our plot unless you do,‚Äù declar$Emotion picture man.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù inquired Mr. King with a smile, ‚Äúwas you ever up in a monoplane?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell‚Äîno.$Try it once, with eye, hands and mind set on dodging a single quirk that may send you diving like an arrow, a$will understand that I can‚Äôt run my machine and drop a rope at the same time.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, the best part of the scenario is where the convict is told by the note left by his wife to look out for the rescue. As I said, you was to swoop near him,$ƒthe rope.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat does the convict do then?‚Äù questioned the aviator, with an amused smile.
‚ÄúHe grabs $l, up he goes, and bang! bang! go the rifles of the guards.‚Äù
‚ÄúSee here, Mr. Alden,‚Äù objected the airman, ‚Äúdo you know how long that convict would hold on to that rope?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt$'	six feet. Just clutches it for an instant. Only enough to take the act of rising. Then we shut off the camera. We finish up his dashing against chimneys, flag poles and$Flouds with a dummy in our studio.‚Äù
‚ÄúI see,‚Äù nodded Mr. King, enlightened. ‚ÄúAbout dropping that rope, though, some one will have to assist me. Let one of your men go up$™me.‚Äù
Just here the hunter man sneaked behind the automobile. The Indian actor got very busy donning the garb of a prison guard.
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt seem to want to try it,‚Äù laughed Mr. King.
‚ÄúWould I do?‚Äù asked Dave, promptly stepping forw$v very thing,‚Äù exclaimed the motion picture man.
‚ÄúNot afraid, Dashaway?‚Äù asked Mr. King.
‚ÄúAfraid? With you? I‚Äôd be the happiest boy in the world,‚Äù declared Dave.
‚ÄúAll right‚Äîget aboard,‚Äù direct$∫aviator.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your rope,‚Äù added the motion picture man. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll signal with a flag when I want you to make the swoop, Mr King.‚Äù
The airman pointed to a seat directly behind his own. Nimbly Dave clambered over the wing and gear$began his first ride in an airship.
CHAPTER XV

THE PARACHUTE GARMENT
‚ÄúOh!‚Äù said Dave Dashaway simply,$V transport of delight.
There was a creak, a hum. Its even keel protected by two hangar men waiting ready for the task, the Aegis moved forward on its rubber shod wheels revolving on ball bearing axles in a soft, lifting glide that was indescribable$„ monoplane progressed in a straight line for perhaps forty feet. Then it took$5away flight.
Dave knew nothing of the mechanism of the plane. His eyes were fixed in a fascinated way on the aviator. With supreme faith in the expertness$|	an guiding the frail yet sturdy craft, Dave did not experience a single qualm of fear. To every move of the skilled hand$airman the splendid construction responded instantly. Dave had just one vivid sense of air sailing, safe and ecstatic, as$sAegis arose like an arrow to what seemed dizzying height. Then it began gracefully circling the aviation field.
Dave sat so near to the airman that he had him in full view. He could catch his every word and movement.
‚ÄúJust fee$ç
ir,‚Äù yelled Mr. King. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs prime. Now then, slip that strap across your waist.‚Äù
‚ÄúI shan‚Äôt fall out. I‚Äôm holding on tight$Üback Dave, his utterance coming in little gasping jerks.
‚ÄúNever mind. Do as I say. That‚Äôs it. Now I‚Äôll tell you something.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù nodded$ñ attentively.
‚ÄúStart in the teeth of the wind, always. I‚Äôm feeling it now,‚Äù and the expert bent a cheek to one side. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ten mile zephyr. Tha$easy.‚Äù
The aviator did no fancy or trick air sailing. He kept widening his circles and increas$speed. With a swift movement he took a lateral dart over towards a hill, passed beyond it, made a sharp turn, and then another ascent.
Of a sudden there was a dip. The hand of the aviator$®d quick as lightning to the mechanism controlling the elevator.
‚ÄúWhew! we struck a hole that time,‚Äù he exclaimed.
‚ÄúA hole?‚Äù repeated Dave vaguely.
‚ÄúYes, a hole in the air. That angle I turned was too sharp, but luckily$≥ was neutral. It‚Äôs too gusty. We‚Äôve got to volplane.‚Äù
Now came the crisis. Dave was nearly thrown out of the seat as a stray wind gust caught the tail of the plane. The machin$aup perpendicularly. Dave was not alarmed, but he was thrilled and excited. He could tell from the face of the aviator that Mr. King was working out some delicate problem of balance and adjustment. Abruptly the machine right$§sailed downwards on a sharp slant.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming$. pancake. Lucky for us,‚Äù spoke Mr. King in a tone of voice decidedly strained. ‚ÄúIf we hadn‚Äôt, we would have scraped a wing, sure as fate.‚Äù
They were now directly over the field. Dave made out the motion picture group.
‚Äú$ƒ,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI think the manager is waving a flag.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs our signal. We‚Äôll cut the circle next whirl around the course. Everything in place below there?‚Äù
$†it is,‚Äù replied Dave, glancing down. ‚ÄúThe convict is ready for us, I am sure.‚Äù
The airman had superb control of his machine. He had descended to a one hundred foot level, and narrowed the circles as they got directly above the spot wher$man dressed in convict garb was seated. The latter was watching for them. Near by two prison guards were walking up and down. Dave had tied one end of the rope to the arm of the seat he occupi$úother end, weighted, was coiled up in his lap.
‚ÄúNow,‚Äù ordered Mr. King, slowing up and directing the machine not thirty feet above the ground.
Dave dropped the$ô	 end of the rope. The convict threw down his hammer and grasped it. Bang! bang! went the rifles$Oclung on, starting a seeming flight skywards. He let go five feet from the ground, and that section of the motion picture was cut off.
Mr. King made a quick close landing. They had to roll fifty$Üover the course to escape a collision with a biplane just getting ready for a flight.
The motion picture manager came up to them smiling and pleased.
‚ÄúThat was first class,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe got$¿basis for one-half dozen airship scenes, Mr. King. See here, this gentleman has made a proposition to me that strikes me right. He wants to talk it over with you.‚Äù
The airman turned to find himself facing the old inventor. Dave noticed$Öthe latter was full of some excitement.
‚ÄúMr. King, you can do me the biggest favor of my life,‚Äù declared Mr. Dixon earnestly.
‚ÄúIndeed‚Äîhow is that?‚Äù asked the aviator.
‚ÄúMy parachute garment, you know. You said you would take up the m$Ôith me this afternoon.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know I did, and so I will.‚Äù
‚ÄúI want you to anticipate that.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn what way?$8s talking to the motion picture man here, and he made a new suggestion to me. You know how anxious I am to get my invention before the public. It would about make me to have a test made to-day, and the trial photographed, and$s shown all over the country in moving picture shows.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat is quite an idea for a fact,‚Äù agreed the airman.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt it be arranged?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, here,‚Äù broke in the manager. ‚ÄúI have thought out quite a little scheme. If I could get a$–	of some one jumping from an airship it would be a thrilling and a genuine novelty. You see, I c$7work in quite a story.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow?‚Äù asked Mr. King, getting interested.
‚ÄúWell, that man over yonder with the torpedo monoplane says he‚Äôll join$èfor a consideration. Your airship is supposed to contain a fugitive from justice, bent on escaping by the air route. The torpedo monoplane is a sort of police aircraft, in pursuit. Work up a regular chase. The criminal springs from your$ljust as the pursuer is about to overtake you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI can see quite some pretty play possible,‚Äù said Mr. King. ‚ÄúHave you found one ready to risk his neck getting into your parachute suit?‚Äù he asked of$«inventor.
‚ÄúYou thought you could find my man for me,‚Äù reminded the latte$EThat‚Äôs so.‚Äù
Mr. King glanced over at Dave. He reflected silently for a moment or two. Then he beckoned$B aside from the others.
‚ÄúSee here, Dashaway,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve heard what these people are putting up to me?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir, I understand$Üsituation,‚Äù answered Dave.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some money in this for whoever tries it. I wouldn‚Äôt let a novice take a risk, but I‚Äôll say from what I‚Äôve seen of the parachute suit of this old fellow that it‚Äôs no great trick to$yshort drop in it.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen why not let me try it?‚Äù asked Dave.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre willing?‚Äù
‚ÄúMore than willing$_Well, I‚Äôll tell you what$do. The old inventor is pestering me to death, and while I‚Äôd be glad to help him along, I also want to get rid of him. He‚Äôll be satisfied if he can announce to airmen generally that a successful test$[s device was made from the Aegis, under my supervision. I think I‚Äôll let you try it.‚Äù
The airman again consulted with the inventor and the motion picture manager. A few minutes later some arrangement seemed to be agreed upon. T$lwent away. The manager proceeded over to the torpedo monoplane. When the inventor came back he had a long box under his arm. He, the airman and Dave went over to where the Aegis stood. T$tproduced his patent parachute suit from the box.
He explained how it worked as Dave put it on. Then the airman and Dave went aloft on a little run in the machine. At twenty feet, and then at fifty fee$ßground Dave jumped from the monoplane. In both instances he descended through$6air light as a feather. He not only landed safely on his feet, but he did not experience the least disturbing jar.
While they were thus practicing for a more spectacular leap, Dave could se$fold inventor almost dancing around with suspense and satisfaction. The camera man was notified that the Aegis was ready for its part in the picture$Rtorpedo monoplane got aloft, and the scene began.
Dave by this time felt so safe, easy and at home up in the air, that he greatly enjoye$imock chase. It was like two immense birds in a race. The machines came pretty close together finally on a level about one hundred feet from the ground.
Dave caught the signal for the drop$5
motion picture manager below.
‚ÄúReady,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúBe careful, Dashaway,‚Äù warned Mr. King.
‚ÄúHere she goes,‚Äù answered Dave simply, and shot earthwards.
CHAPTER XVI

THE YOUNG AVIATOR
‚ÄúThere he is, Dave$∞
Hiram Dobbs.
‚ÄúYes, that is Jerry Dawson, sure enough.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou see he is here$I knew before this that he was,‚Äù replied Dave. ‚ÄúMr. King told m$7morning that young Dawson and his father were both working for an airman named Russell.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, Dave,‚Äù said Hiram in quite a serious tone, ‚ÄúI want you to look out for that fellow$d	hy? I never did him any harm.‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm around a good deal, and I hear a lot of things you don‚Äôt. That Jerry Dawson is a selfish, vicious boy. His father, they say, is almost as bad$}the man they are working for, Russell, has been barred from some meets on account of winning an altitude race by a trick.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of$r
too,‚Äù responded Dave. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs no friend of Mr. King, and that‚Äôs enough for me. As to Jerry, though, I have no business with him, and don‚Äôt intend to have if I can help it.‚Äù
$üll cross your path in some mean way, you mark my words,‚Äù said Hiram warningly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got an idea that he owes Mr. King a grudge, and h$7crazy to pay it off. Down by the south pylons early this morning, I saw him talking to two of the roughest looking fellows I ever met. You was at your practice, and Jerry pointed you out to the men, and was whisper$Ühem‚Äîsomething about you, I‚Äôll bet.‚Äù
‚Äú$keep an eye out for him, but I‚Äôm not a bit scared,‚Äù said Dave.
Hiram spoke of pylons just now as if he had known what they meant all his life. It was nearly a week after his first meeting with Dave, and a vast improvemen$Lvisible in the manner, position and finances of the humble but ambitious farm lad.
Hiram had gone to work with a vengeance. Mr. King had told him that there were many steps to the ladder leading to fame and fortune in the aviation field, and $ü
taken this literally.
‚ÄúWhy, I‚Äôm willing to scrub floors, work as candy butcher, tar ropes, wash dishes, peddle programmes, anything honest to reach that first rung,‚Äù he had told Dave back at Fairfield. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make good every step I $Ò, no matter how slow or hard it is, I‚Äôm going to become an aviator, like yourself, Dave.‚Äù
‚ÄúM$*?‚Äù smiled Dave. ‚ÄúYou flatter me, Hiram.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo I?‚Äù retorted Hiram. ‚ÄúWell, then, so does Mr. King. And your teacher, old Grimshaw. He says he never saw a person take to the business like you do.$j	 was bragging about you, too, down at the office yesterday. He actually talked$Aentering you in one of the races next week.‚Äù
Dave flushed with pleasure. He was too sensible to imagine himself a full-fledged aviator, or anything like it. At$ãsame time, he could not deny that he had learned a great many new things within the past ten days.
He did not look much like the tired, dusty and threadbare boy who$Äft Brompton hungry, barefooted and practically penniless. The one hundred feet descent from the Aegis in the old inventor‚Äôs parachute garment had been a complete success. I$ put Dave in funds, too, for Mr. Dixon had given him a ten dollar bill for his services.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt pretend to be much more than a rediscoverer as to my parachute device,‚Äù$èacknowledged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to date, and it does what I claim for it, though. Tell you, Dashaway, I‚Äôll be over to the Dayton meet, and$'add a five dollar bill to every one hundred feet you drop with my apparatus.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt really does work, doesn‚Äôt it, Mr. King?‚Äù Dave asked of the aviator a little later.
‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù replied the airman, somewhat indifferently. $òwon‚Äôt sell much, though, outside of amateurs.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù
‚ÄúA professional won‚Äôt admit any lack of skill or pluck, any more than a crack swimmer would use a life preserver. Another thing,$;	operator can‚Äôt be hampered with a suit tied around his ankles. Still another thing, when the moment arrives for an airman to desert the ship, things are so desperate he has$£much chance of jumping clear of the machine.‚Äù
Dave had also received some money from the motion picture manager. Then Mr. King handed him what was due him of a modest salary for the broken week.
Saturday afternoo$`d arranged to ship his traps to Dayton, all except the monoplane, in which he and his young assistant made the trip.
Dave fou$.friend, Hiram, on the new grounds. The country boy was in high spirits. He had worked tirelessly while at Fairfield. When there were no visitors to the$~, he went into the town. He sold out a lot of leftover souvenirs, and that Saturday afternoon boasted gleefully of being for$nfirst time in his life the possessor of ten dollars.
‚ÄúAll my own,‚Äù he announced, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm going to tidy up a bit. Come and help me pick out a cheap suit, Dave.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, and I need a complete outfit myself,‚Äù explained$C ‚ÄúI tell you, Hiram, this is a great day for two poor fellows who hadn‚Äôt a quarter between them a week ago.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd see what we are learning,‚Äù added$ç. ‚ÄúIf ever airshipping gets to be the go for traveling about, we‚Äôll be in right on the jump, won‚Äôt we?‚Äù
Mr. King was pleased to se$himproved appearance of his young apprentice in a neat sensible suit of clothes. He had taken a decided liking to Dave, who was quick, reliable and accommodating.$1 felt like a bird given its freedom after a long and irksome captivity. His head was full of aviation all of the time, however, and the various airmen he got acquainted with were all willi$églad to answer his questions about this and that detail of the different make machines.
Monday morning, Mr. King had taken Dave down to a roped-off section$daviation field. It held a tent covering an old type airplane, and also housing a queer old fellow with one arm, whom the airman introduced to Dave as Mr. Grimshaw.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the young$_I was telling you about,‚Äù said Mr. King. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find him a likely pupil.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll soon know it, if that‚Äôs so,‚Äù responded the gruff, grim old fellow. ‚ÄúPut him right through the regular course of sprouts, eh?‚Äù
‚ÄúT$xwhat I want. It‚Äôs $he wants, too. Make it special, Grimshaw. I‚Äôve great hopes of him, and don‚Äôt$N him worked in a crowd.‚Äù
Dave understood that his kind employer was spending some money for his instruction. He felt duly grateful. He entered into his$ï with vim and ardor, determined to make rapid progress, to show Mr. King how he appreciated his friendly interest in him.
For three days Dave was with Grimshaw from ten to twelve o‚Äôclock in the morning and two to four$afternoon. The rest of the time he was helping about the little building, where Mr. King made his headquarters. His employer was preparing to enter for the first day‚Äôs altitude prize. There$Cacticing to do, and the Aegis needed constant attention. Dave now knew how to oil it, keep the tanks full and clean u$monoplane.
Dave had heard that his gruff old tutor, Grimshaw, had been quite a balloonist in his time. A fall from an airship had crippled him. He was useful$Dline, however, kept pace with all the new wrinkles in aviation, and ran a kind of school for amateurs.
From the first step in learning how to run the airplane, to the point when$ô wild cheer Dave felt himself safe in making a brief flight all by$-, our hero‚Äôs progress was one of unceasing interest and delight.
The first step was to learn how to glide. Dave aboard the$r, Grimshaw and an assistant helped get the airplane under way. They carried the weight of the machine and overcame its head resistance by running forward at its own rate of speed.
Over the course Dave ran and repeated. As the glider cut into$À, the wind caused by the running caught under the uplifted edge of the curved planes, buoying up the machine and causing it to rise. At first Dave lifted only a foot or two clear$sground. Then he projected his feet slightly forward, so as to shift the center of gravity a trifle and bring the edges of the glider on an exact level parallel with the $©
‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù old Grimshaw would say, ‚Äúyou scoop up the advancing air and rise upon it. Kee$)planes steady, for if they tilt the air is spilled.‚Äù
Dave soon learned the rudiments. He knew that in his first experiment he must watch out that the rear end of the skids or the tail did not scrape ove$urf or slap the ground hard and break off. He kept the machine always under control, so it would not get tail heavy. He guarded against wing deflection, and the second day felt proud as a king when his tutor relented from his usual grimness$Yold him quite emphatically that he would ‚Äúdo.‚Äù
‚ÄúNever stubbed the toe of the machine, and that‚Äôs pretty fine for a beginner,‚Äù commented the veteran airman.
It was not until Dave had a chance at a real biplane$¿	felt that he had gained a glorious promotion. He spent hours looking over a technical book Mr. King had loaned him. He hung around old Grimshaw every spare momen$ôcould find. It was the afternoon on his third day‚Äôs tuition when Dave started his first real flight.
He had learned the perfect use of the rudder from running the airplane up and down the ground. Dave knew the danger of leav$Ecourse unexpectedly in his frequent practice runs. He knew how to gauge a rush of air against the face,$-use the elevator as a brake to keep from pitching forward. Dave had mastered a heap of important details, and felt strong confidence in himself.
Dave rose a few feet$Çthe ground with the motor wide open. He moved the rudder very gingerly. The switch was of the knife variety, an$Cthrottle and advance spark were in the form of pedals working against springs.
‚ÄúReady,‚Äù called out Grimshaw, in his strange forbidding voice$C
 I am,‚Äù warbled Dave, keen for the contest of his skill.
‚ÄúThen let her go.‚Äù
The biplane took a superb shoot into the air.
Dave was not afraid of forgetting how to run the machine straight ahead. He had watched Mr. King at the level too oft$€	at. He got fairly aloft, tried coasting, veered, struck a new level, and worked the ailerons to decrease any tendency for tipping.
On his second turn Dave had to use the emergency brake, the stout bar of steel on$kid near the rear end. He banked on a spirited whirl, got his level, circled$Dcourse twice, and came back to the ground flushed with excitement and delight, without so much as a wrinkle put in the staunch aircraft.
It was on this account that Dave felt proud and then modest, as his$V	friend, Hiram, referred to him as an aviator. He had entire confidence now in his ability to manage an airship alone. Dav$Jsome pretty ambitious dreams as he went on his way. Great preparations were being made for the meet, which was to open the next morning.
Dave kept busy about the Aegis quarters. Just at dusk Mr. King sent him to the town near by to order $Ósupplies from a hardware store. Dave attended to his commissions and started back for the grounds an hour later.
Just as he passed through the crowd about the main entrance to the aviation field our hero turned$]heard a voice say quickly and in a meaning way:
‚ÄúThere he is!‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs the Dashaway fellow,‚Äù was responded.
Dave made out two forms skulking into$Mshadow of the office building. Then some passersby shut$.m out from view.
‚ÄúHello,‚Äù said Dave to himself, ‚Äúthat sounds and looks suspicious.‚Äù
CHAPTER XVII

KIDNAPPED
If Hiram Dobbs had not pronounced so serious a warning only a few hours previous,$£would not have paid much attention to the incident of$moment.
Hiram had spoken of two rough looking characters in the company of Jerry Dawson. Here were a couple who filled the bill, strangers to Dave, and yet spea$whis name in a way that was sinister.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone, whoever they are,‚Äù said Dave a few moments later, and dismissed them from his mind fo$Q time being.
He walked down the row of automobiles and other vehicles lining the main entrance road. There was quite a crowd. General admission to the grounds was free to any one respectable that day and even$»Outside of the curious visitors who had gone the rounds of the hangars, there were groups of airmen and others discussing the feature$O	morrow‚Äôs flights.
Dave passed along through the crowds, interested in all he saw. When he got to that part of the broad roadway where the booths and crowds were sparser, he deviated to cross towards the hangars at one side$tgreat course.
He met a few people and her$	there came across tents given to the exhibiting of some new model, or occupied by employees who worked about the field. Most of those who ate and slept on the grounds, however, were down a$Qcenter of animation near the big gate, and Dave‚Äôs walk was a rather lonely one.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be the week of my life,‚Äù thought the youth. ‚ÄúI wonder if there‚Äôs any hope at all$Ktaking a flight, as Hiram hinted. Not but that I believe I could manage a biplane as well as any amateur. Hello!‚Äù
Dave was rudely aroused from his glowing dreams as he passed a tent where a man with a lantern$Ztinkering over a motorcycle. Happening to glance back, Dave saw two stealthy figures in the dim distance.
‚ÄúThey are the men I noticed at the entrance,‚Äù decided Dave. ‚ÄúThere, they‚Äôve split up. One has gone out of sight around the tent, a$other has made a pretence of stopping to watch the fellow mending that motorcycle.‚Äù
Dave hastened his speed, making straight for the hangars. The row in which Mr. King hous$Mmachine was quite remote from the others. It was bright starlight, and glancing over his shoulders several times Dave was sure that he made out the two men h$)spicious of following in his tracks.
They neared him as he passed a row of temporary buildings. Dave had a mind to stop at one of these until his pursuers, if such they were, had made themselves scarce. Then, however,$•glanced around, he caught no sight of them.
‚ÄúPshaw!‚Äù said Dave, ‚Äúwhat am I afraid of? Perhaps I‚Äôm making a mystery out of nothing. If those fellows intended to do me any harm, they‚Äôd have got at me long since. T$$ve had plenty of chances. I‚Äôll make a bee line for home and forget all about them.‚Äù
Dave put across an unoccupied space. At its edge were three temporary buildings. Two he knew held airships. One was quite famou$¿t belonged to a wealthy man named Marvin, who made aeronautics a fad. His machine was a splendid military monoplane of the latest model, and was list$çdo some heavy air work in the next day‚Äôs programme.
All the buildings were dark. Nobody seemed in their vicinity until Dave neared the larger one of the three where the military machine was housed. Then suddenly around one corner$Tcanvas house two men came into view.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve run him home, I guess,‚Äù spoke the quick voice of one of them.
‚ÄúYes, there he goes, making for the tent,‚Äù was the retort given in a breath.
Dave recognized the men $9fellows who had been so persistently following him. They had run ahead, it seemed, and waited for his coming. As they made a move towards him, sh$hthat they intended to reach and seize him, Dave started running around the other side of the building. At this the men separated. One circled$5 and headed him off. Dave ran back ten feet out of sight. Then, hearing the other fellow running on from the opposite direction,$lcrowded through a half open sliding door.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù sounded on the outside, a minute late$;No, he‚Äôs slipped into that shed. I tell you we‚Äôve run him home, and if nobody else is around we can soon finish up our business neat and quick.‚Äù
Dave did not know what that ‚Äú$;‚Äù was. He stood still in the darkness and listened. His hand had touched the bamboo edge of a machine wing$ewas thinking of seeking a hiding place, or some other door or window outlet from the shed, when a sudden flash blinded and confused him.
His pursuers had followed him into the$è. One of them carried a portable electric light. Pressing its button, and focu$
rays first on one spot and then on another, its holder soon rested a steady glare on Dave.
‚ÄúThere he is,‚Äù sounded out.
‚ÄúYes, grab him.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right$Got him?‚Äù
‚ÄúSure and safe.‚Äù
Dave‚Äôs captor had great brawny hands and handled the youth as he would a child. The men had come prepared for rough and ready action$6ruffian had felled Dave with a jerk and a slam, kept beside him, and in a twinkling had his hands and feet bound tightly. Dave set up a sharp outcry.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll soon settle that,‚Äù said his captor grimly.
Dave‚Äôs lips were muffled$—gag so tightly fastened that for a few minutes he could scarcely breathe. The man who had dealt so summarily with him arose to his feet.
‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù asked his companion.
‚ÄúGo out and see if t$ïast is clear.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know it is‚Äîour way. We‚Äôre to make direct for the high fence behind the hangars. Near the freight gate, you know. We can open it from the inside.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be in a hurry, then. Remember there‚Äôs something else to do$È
haven‚Äôt forgotten it. The job‚Äôs easy this far. Come ahead.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to carry him?$!Yes.‚Äù
Dave was lifted up and swung along by the two men as if he were a bag of grain. They made straight for the high rear fence of the grounds. This they followed for a few hundred feet.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the gate,‚Äù announced on$b	men, and they dropped Dave to the ground.
There was a jangling of chains and hasps. From where he lay Dave could see the open country beyond the gateway. He was carried through. Several vehicles were in view$Ã	 horses attached to most of them were hit$trees or the fence supports. Their owners, Dave judged, were up at a place some distance away. Here there were lights and animation. Dave knew that the building was located there, outside of the grounds, wh$n supplies from farmers and by rail were received.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù spoke one of the men carrying him, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs half a dozen horses and wagons here.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a light wagon with a white horse we were directed to$IThere it is‚Äîsee that white horse yonder?‚Äù
‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right. Toddle along. This is no light lump of a youngster.‚Äù
The men reached a$0wagon. Its box was littered with straw and a lot of empty bags. It looked to Dave as if its owner had brought a load of potatoes to the aero meet.
‚ÄúGive him a hoist,‚Äù ordered one of the men.
Dave$πfted, swung, and dropped. He sank down among the bags and the straw almost out of sight.
‚ÄúNow where‚Äôs the man we were to meet, the driver of the wagon?‚Äù inquire$nfellow who had bound and gagged Dave.
‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôll probably be here soon. You stay and wait for him$Qive him his orders. I‚Äôll go back and finish up the job.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do it alone. It won‚Äôt take but a few minutes. You may want me to hold a light, or something.‚Äù
‚ÄúGot the tools?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes‚Äù‚Äîand the last speaker jangled$L
 metallic in his pockets.
‚ÄúAll right. Let‚Äôs waste no time. This is pretty neat, I call it‚Äîthe lad settled, and the machine no good. I‚Äôm thinking old King will do some storming, when he tries another flight.‚Äù
‚ÄúI$O so, too. Come on,‚Äù was the retort, and$two men disappeared through the gateway of the aviation field.
CHAPTER XVIII

AN ALL-NIGHT CAPTIVITY
Dave sank down in his soft bed of bags and straw, unable to move hand or foot.
The$¥who had made him a helpless prisoner$!done their work well. Dave could not use a muscle. As to dislodging the gag or shouting, that seemed entirely out of$1question.
The youth had lots of time to think. He blinked up at the stars, kept his ears on$alert, and waited for further developments.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something to Hiram$warning, sure enough,‚Äù he reflected. ‚ÄúIf this is the work of Jerry Dawson, he must be a pretty desperate fellow.‚Äù
Then Dave began to worry. The last overheard words of his captors we$±lightening. They had spoken as if it was fully intended to get him away from his present pleasant employment and keep$7it. What affected Dave most seriously, however, was the hint of the two men that they had some evil designs against the Aegis.
‚ÄúI think I guess it out,‚Äù mus$ë, very much wrought up mentally. ‚ÄúJerry Dawson and his father are bent on getting me out of the way, and at the same time$0	even with Mr. King, as they call it. I don‚Äôt see what they hope to gain. Mr. King wouldn‚Äôt take Jerry back in his employ in a thousand years, and they$Gdare to do me any real harm. It would cost them money to have me shut up anywhere for any length of time, and the Dawsons haven‚Äôt got any too muc$4hat. Besides, they won‚Äôt hold me long,‚Äù declared Dave doughtily, ‚Äúif I get a chance to slip them.‚Äù
$6counted the minutes, quite curious as well as anxious to find out what the next step in the programme would be. Then he heard voices approaching.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming back,‚Äù decided Dave, ‚Äúno,‚Äù he corrected himself, ‚Äúthose are not their$v.‚Äù
‚ÄúUnhitch him, Jared,‚Äù spoke unfamiliar tones.
‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù responded a boyish voice. ‚ÄúStraight for home, father?$~Yes, we‚Äôll be late as it is, and mother will be uneasy. Give me the lines. I$Gdrive.‚Äù
Two persons, apparently father and son, lifted themselves up into the front seat of the wagon, and the horse started up.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs queer,‚Äù ruminated Dave, ‚Äúmighty$$. Why, they don‚Äôt act as if they cared if I was smothering or already smothered. Wh$K
they wait for the two men who put me in this awful fix?‚Äù
The wagon crossed a patch of open ground. Then a smooth country road was reached and the horse jogged along his way.
‚ÄúPretty good price$ª	stuff you got, wasn‚Äôt it, father?‚Äù asked the boy.
‚ÄúYes, these shows pay us well,‚Äù was the response.
‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm nobody and nothing, it seems,‚Äù thought Dave. ‚ÄúWish I had the use of my tongue for about two minutes. I‚Äôd ask$Æpeople what they intend to do with me. They don‚Äôt appear like very bloodthirsty fellows. Maybe, though, they‚Äôre hired to dump me into the first river they come to, and$Ä	mind it so long as they get the money.‚Äù
Not a word was spoken by either father or son that showed the least interest on their part i$helpless passenger. Finally the boy said:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to rain, father. I felt a sprinkle just then.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll be home in ten minutes.‚Äù
Dave had noticed that$ësky had clouded up. A few drops of rain spattered his face. Then the horse took a turn, entered a farm yard, and was halted.
‚ÄúYou go into the house, father,‚Äù said the boy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put up$Ä
.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right, give him his feed, and say, Jared, you needn‚Äôt bother pulling the wagon in.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust as you say, father.‚Äù
‚ÄúThrow a hay tarpaulin over the box, so the bags won‚Äôt get soaked, that‚Äôs all$X
e mischief!‚Äù reflected Dave. ‚ÄúAre they thinking of leaving me out in a rainstorm all night?‚Äù
Apparently this was just what the farmer boy was going to do. He unhitched the horse and led him into the stable. Then he ca$†carrying a great cover, whistling carelessly. He gave the tarpaulin a whirl, and it flopped over the box of the wagon, shutting Dave in snugly. Then, as there came a dash of rain,$Sy ran for the house, and Dave could hear him run up a pair of steps and slam a door after him.
‚ÄúWell!‚Äù
Dave nearly exploded with wonder, dismay and disgust. He wrenched at his bonds, and gave it up. He tried to bite the gag in his mouth fre$‚abandoned that futile attempt also.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm certainly booked for a spell right where I am,‚Äù decided Dave. ‚ÄúMaybe those two fellows who captured me are to come he$get me or perhaps when the farmer and his son get their supper they‚Äôll come out and move me somewhere else.‚Äù
Nothing of the kind, however, happened. All Dave could do was to rest snugly in one position and listen to the rain patter down o$›protecting tarpaulin. An hour went by very slowly. Once in a while Dave could catch the echo of a voice singing inside the farm house. Finally he heard some windows shut down. Then everything became still. He knew now that the people in the$q had gone to bed.
Dave got tired of listening to the ceaseless piping of the crickets in the grass and the croak$.frogs in a pond near by.
‚ÄúI might just as well try to go to sleep myself, too,‚Äù he told himself. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be in no shape for the big day to-morrow.‚Äù
There Dave faltered, with a pang that sent his heart way down into his shoes. T$\ow! It would an anxious day for him, if he was kept in captivity. And Mr. King! Dave writhed as he feared the worst.
He quieted himself finally by thinking out a new theory, and this made him feel somewhat hopeful as to$\.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a miss in the plans of those scoundrels,‚Äù flashed into his mind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probable, i$ossible, yes, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôll bet!‚Äù decided Dave.
He felt more patient and satisfied now. The boy concluded that the two men who had captured him had picked out the wrong white horse. There had been$çof that color among those hitched near the freight gate at the aviation grounds.
‚ÄúThey put me in the wrong wagon,‚Äù thought Dave, ‚Äúand here I am. What will they do when$learn of their terrific blunder?‚Äù
Dave chuckled over this. If it had not been for his active fears as to some designs against Mr. King and the Aegis, $twould have felt quite jubilant.
‚ÄúIt will be all right in the morning,‚Äù he tried to believe, and finally went to sleep.
The loud barking of a dog aroused our hero. The tarpaulin was shaking$bas its edges flapped about Dave could tell that it was broad daylight.
‚ÄúHere, Tige, what are you up to?‚Äù shouted a familiar voice.
It was that of the farmer boy who had covered Dave up in the wagon box the evening previous.
$…race the movements of the dog, probably just released from his kennel by his early rising young master doing his chores about the barn yard. The animal barked unceasingly, circled the wagon and tore at the dangling end$…	tarpaulin. Dave could hear the paws of the dog as in his excitement he tried to clamber up into the vehicle.
‚ÄúWhat is it, Tige‚Äîa cat under there?‚Äù spoke the farm boy, his voice apparently nearer.
Just then,$L
 dog‚Äôs pulling, the tarpaulin slid clear off to the ground. Dave was dazzled by a blinding glare of sunlight.
The farmer boy sprang upon a wheel hub and looked down in$zwagon box, the dog clawing and panting at his heels. The eyes of$6amazed lad fell upon Dave.
‚ÄúFor goodness sake!‚Äù shouted the farmer boy. ‚ÄúWhere did you come from?‚Äù
CHAPTER XIX

ANOTHER MISTAKE
Dave Dashaway‚Äôs limbs were stiff and his lip$ore. He could not move nor speak. He tried to smile to reassure the farmer boy, who looked startled and scared.
The latter swept asid$Gloose litter of straw and bags. The minute he got a view of Dave‚Äôs condition he turned pale, jumped down from the wheel hub and shouted out wildly:
‚ÄúFather, father‚Äîcome here quick!‚Äù
The dog kept running around$jagon making a great ado. Finally some one seemed to come from the house in response to the call of the farmer boy, for a voice inquired:
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the row here?‚Äù
‚ÄúA boy in that wagon box.‚Äù
‚ÄúSome tramp, I suppose$But he‚Äôs all tied up with ropes. There‚Äôs even something tied in his mouth, so he can‚Äôt talk‚Äîonly stare and grin.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say!‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, I do. Look for yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell! w$
‚Äù
As the farmer lifted himself up on$ wagon box and took a look at Dave, his eyes grew big as saucers. He felt along the cord coming tightly across Dave‚Äôs cheeks$tof the rope binding his body.
‚ÄúJared, run into the house, quick, and get your mother‚Äôs scissors,‚Äù he ordered.
The old man hoisted himself to the edge $úwagon box, and simply gaped at Dave, as if too puzzled to figure out how his strange situation had come about.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the scissors, father,‚Äù finally reported the boy, who had hurried into the house$¬out of it again.
The old man went to work on Dave as tenderly as if he had been a kitten. He carefully snipped the gag cords.
‚ÄúBless me!‚Äù he said, as he notic$6big red welts across Dave‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúThis is mighty cruel I tell you. Now then,‚Äù as he cut the ropes at hands and feet, ‚Äúget up and$Lus what this means.‚Äù
Dave tried to and failed. His tongue was so dry and swollen that he could not articulate$@whole body was numb and spiritless. The farmer saw his helplessness, ordered his son to let down the high tailboard of the wagon, and they gradually slid Dave to the ground and held him up.
Gentle mannered people these, Dave decided,$= was ashamed of himself for ever thinking that they were parties to the kidnapping plot of the two men who had captured him the night previous.
‚ÄúWalk him a bit, Jared, softly now$,‚Äù the farmer said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in a mortal bad fix, circulation nigh stopped and weak as a cat. I reckon we‚Äôd better get him into the house.‚Äù
T$é	‚Äôs wife looked surprised as her husband carried Dave to a couch in the family sitting room and placed him upon it.
‚ÄúWhy, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù she exclaimed.
‚ÄúI$"either a measly trick or attempted killing,‚Äù replied the old man indignantly. ‚ÄúSpeak up, lad, how did you come in that plight?‚Äù
‚ÄúWater!‚Äù was all that Dave could choke out, an$Égood housewife soon had a glass at his lips.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stand gawking at the poor fellow and pestering him with questions,‚Äù cried the farmer‚Äôs wife. ‚ÄúHe needs some $™t coffee and some strengthening food to brace him up,‚Äù and the speaker hurried to the kitchen, where Dave could hear$:izzling of bacon.
‚ÄúI can talk to you now, sir,‚Äù he said, but weakly, taking another gulp of the reviving water. ‚ÄúI was kidnapped.‚Äù
‚ÄúHey!‚Äù ejaculated the farmer, with a start.
‚ÄúYes, sir$@In my wagon?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat was a mistake, I believe. Two rough men were hired to tie me up and gag me and put me in a wagon in waiting outside of the aero grounds. They mistook yours for the one they should have$j
.‚Äù
‚ÄúGracious!‚Äù
‚ÄúThey went back into the grounds, and you came along and drove me off with you before they returned$zYou don‚Äôt mean to say you‚Äôve been lying in that wagon ever since last evening?‚Äù
‚ÄúI do,‚Äù replied Dave.
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you kick and holler$BHow could I?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so. Well, you just get a bit of breakfast and mended up, and I‚Äôll drive you back to town. I hope you intend to get those critters arrested.$ùI certainly shall try and find them,‚Äù said Dave.
In a very few minutes our hero was as good as ever, as the saying goes. He was young, healthy, active, and as soon as his blood got to circulating, the stiffness and soreness began to go away.
$ybetter than ever, he told himself, after a breakfast so elegant, home-like, and plentiful, that he made the farmer‚Äôs wife flush with pleasure over his compliments.
T$>boy took particular interest in Dave, when he learned that he was employed among ‚Äúthe balloon men.‚Äù Dave did not go into details or mention names, for h$1
want anything to get out about his kidnapping until he had consulted Mr. King.
He was anxious and glad, when two hours later, the farmer drew up his horse at the main entrance to the aero grounds. Dave made$1n accept a dollar for all his trouble, which the farmer took reluctantly, saying he would invest it in kitchen aprons$dhis wife. Dave also told him how to send word to him, if he wished to visit the meet any day during the week.
‚ÄúYou can count on free passes,‚Äù said$ç.
‚ÄúThank you, that will be fine,‚Äù nodded the delighted farmer as he drove off.
Dave dashed breathlessly through the big gateway. He had simply to lift his hand to the gatekeeper, who passed him in with a nod, knowing him and not requir$to show his entrance ticket. Then Dave ran down the course, heading i$direction of the hangars. All his former anxieties came back to him. He was safe and free himself, but what had happened after his two captors had disposed of him?
‚ÄúThey had tools, they talked$πAegis,‚Äù soliloquized Dave. ‚ÄúThey were up to some harm for Mr. King, just the same as myself. Oh, dear, I hope nothing has happened to$=monoplane!‚Äù
Dave passed the building where Hiram made his headquarters. That friend would of course know of his strange spell of absence.$_could probably relieve his present worry or heighten it, but Dave felt that his first duty was to his employer.
‚ÄúHold on, there. Hi, stop, Dave‚ÄîDave Dashaway!‚Äù
This call was bawled out from a window in the building$†had just passed. At once he recognized the voice of his friend. Turning and half halting, Dave made out Hiram waving his hand frantically.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt stop‚Äîsee you later,‚Äù shouted Dave.
‚ÄúMust stop.‚Äù
$fnever waited to make for a door. He jumped recklessly from the window, ran down the road, and overtook his friend.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù he cried, all excitement and curiosity, ‚Äúwhere have you been?‚Äù
‚ÄúLong story. Want to see Mr. King first. H$=seen him?‚Äù
‚ÄúHave I $ repeated Hiram volubly. ‚ÄúHe woke me up at midnight, worried to death about you. Made me get up and join him in a search. He said it wasn‚Äôt like you to be off skylarking, with all there was to think$É, arrange and do for today‚Äôs flight.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe was right there.‚Äù
‚ÄúI knew it, and told him so,‚Äù said Hiram. ‚ÄúThen he got thinking there was foul play somew$hThere was,‚Äù assented Dave.
‚ÄúThat Jerry Dawson?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou$?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot positively. Keep along with me, and I‚Äôll tell you all about it. I‚Äôm on pins and needles till I reach Mr. King. Say, Hiram, answer me one question.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù
‚ÄúHas anything happened to the Aegis$€Why, what could happen?‚Äù inquired Hiram in a puzzled way.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was an hour ago, when I was up at the camp. Mr. King was oiling things up himself, and$ágreat stew about you, but the Aegis was the same old beauty.‚Äù
Dave heaved an immense sigh of relief. They were just then passing the shed into which he had run to escape his pursuers the evening previous. Dave was$Õto point it out to his companion and relate his adventures, when he noticed a big placard on the side of the shed.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that, Hiram?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúOh, that?‚Äù repeated Hiram. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the talk$fmeet. That‚Äôs Marvin‚Äôs monoplane, you know.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù nodded Dave.
‚ÄúWell, some one sneaked into the hangar last night, when all hands were away, and wrecked the machine$ÑWhy!‚Äù exclaimed Dave suddenly‚Äîand then added to himself: ‚ÄúI understand!‚Äù
‚ÄúThat placard,‚Äù continued Hiram, ‚Äúis an offer of a reward of one hundred dollars for the detection of the vandals who did$%astardly work.‚Äù
CHAPTER XX

IN TRAINING
Dave did not speak nor linger. His quick mind was thinking very actively, though. He fancied he understood what the wrecking of the Marvin monoplane meant now.
As they passed the open doorway$Cshed Dave could see a crowd inside inspecting the monoplane it contained. A man he recognized as Mr. Marvin, the wealthy amateur airman, was moving about restlessly and talking in an exciting tone.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a blazing shame!‚Äù broke out Hiram. ‚Äú$óvin intended trying a flight himself to-day. Everybody was encouraging him, and pleased about it. He‚Äôs been awful kind to the air folks, you know.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve hear$Uhim,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúHe donated several of the medals last meet, and made up losses for the crowd where things didn‚Äôt pay.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo they suspect anybody?‚Äù aske$ôNo,‚Äù replied Hiram, shaking his head slowly.
Then he flashed a shrewd look at Dave, full in the face, and bolted out the quick challenge:
‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù
Dave changed color. He walked on a little faster.
‚ÄúWhy, yes, I do,$–to tell you the truth,‚Äù he replied.
‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to say, Hiram, till I am sure.$4Say, Dave Dashaway,‚Äù declared Hiram. ‚ÄúI can bet who it is, first shot. It‚Äôs Jerry Dawson, and you‚Äôve been through a big tussle, for your face is all marked up$G look peaked and worried. Isn‚Äôt it that Dawson fellow, now?‚Äù
Dave was silent.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù stormed Hiram, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt answer, I‚Äôll start right out and find young$Ç, and knock the truth out of him, along with all the rest of his meanness.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou must do nothing of the sort, Hiram,‚Äù remonstrated Dave. ‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt guess anything, or mix up things, until I have seen Mr. King$ìake a fellow mighty curious.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou will know all about it soon,‚Äù promised Dave. ‚ÄúThere is Mr. King now.‚Äù
Our hero hurried forward as he saw just outside the Aegis hangar his employer and old Grimshaw.$q
uttered a glad cry as his eye fell on Dave. The old trainer nodded as pleasantl$>	grim face would allow.
‚ÄúWhy, Dashaway, where have you been?‚Äù asked Mr. King quickly, looking Dave over as h$g	 runaway aeroplane returned.
‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve had a little adventure that isn‚Äôt worth the telling, with all there is to do here this morning,‚Äù declared Dave evasively, pulling off his coat and making a great ado of seeking some immediate work.
Da$œmade up his mind to defer any explanation until later in the day. He realized that it would disturb his employer to relate his adventures and suspicions. Mr. King, too, was a hasty man. Dave knew$vbe just like him to rush off to Mr. Marvin, charge the Dawsons with the wrecking of his monoplane, and become generally unnerved for his critical duties of the day.
Later Dave learned that the men who had kidnapped$ had displaced three important parts of the Marvin monoplane. This had rendered it impossible to use the machine for the day. They had probably thrown the stolen$Éinto some pit or creek. It was evident that the two vandals had blundered all along the line. They had supposed$I
shed where they had cornered Dave was the Aegis hangar, and had dismantled the wrong machine.
Dave became so active, and ther$]so much to do, that he soon drifted his employer‚Äôs thoughts from himself. Mr. King insisted on some explanation, however, and Dave evaded direct information by saying he had got into a farm wagon by mistake, was carted away$gslept in the vehicle all night.
Within an hour Dave and his own little personal affairs were obscured and forgotten for the time being, amid trials of skill and the general environment of an aero meet. As soon as the programme$o	day was started, it$one engrossing novelty and thrill after another.
The Aegis was in for the altitude race. Dave was doubly glad that he had not b$Ued his employer with the real explanation of his absence the night before. The airman was a superb picture of courage, confidence and expertness as the Aegis bounded from earth and rose in the lead over the fleet of airships entered fo$"contest.
Dave helped in skidding the machine at the start, and was promptly on hand when the Aegis sailed gracefully down to its starting point with a score of six hundred extra feet to the Fairfield record.
Mr. King was busy after that consulting$hnd aiding other aviators in their scheduled feats. Dave was just finishing a cold lunch at the hangar, when old Grimshaw poked his head into view past an open doorway.
‚ÄúOff duty, lad?‚Äù he inquired, his twinkling eyes telling$≤that he had something on his mind.
‚ÄúWhy, Mr. King has finished his part in the programme,‚Äù replied Dave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve cleaned up the Aegis, and just waiting for orders.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, $Fjust seen him, and it‚Äôs all right. Like to make some extra money, Dashaway?‚Äù
‚ÄúAlways ready for that,‚Äù replied Dave.
‚ÄúThen you come with me,‚Äù directed Grimshaw. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a quiet corner over against the hangars$’I want you to put in all your spare time for the next two days on biplane practice.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnything special?‚Äù asked Dave, with a hopeful smile.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll answer that when I see you do some grass cutting on the double whirl‚Äîwhich you$Vdo,‚Äù replied Grimshaw with a chuckle.
All that afternoon Dave was put through a series of trial flights by$^	. The attention of the crowd was centered upon the main features$1	ourse, and they were unhindered and practically unnoticed in their efforts. Dave made several rapid flights.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to do,‚Äù commended Grimshaw with great satisfaction, as$lbrought the biplane back to earth for the sixth time without jar or injury.
‚ÄúDo for what?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúYou come down here to-morrow a$âsame time. Next day, too. Then I‚Äôll tell you something that will make your eyes snap.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut why all this mystery, Mr. Grimshaw?‚Äù inquired Dave with a smile.
‚ÄúYou do as I say, if$ëwant to earn a record and some money as the aptest pupil I ever had,‚Äù was all that Grimshaw would explain.
Dave was helping$Vman cook get supper ready at the hangar when Mr. King put in an appearance. The aviator was in high spirits, for the day had been a successful one for him.
Dave told him about his experience with Grimshaw$Çirman nodded pleasantly, as if he understood what was going on.
Hiram came strolling along just as they finished their meal. Mr. K$1djourned to a pile of benches not in use at a little distance from the hangar. He settled down in$Xcomfortable attitude.
‚ÄúNow then, Dashaway,‚Äù he observed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been too busy to bother with the mystery of your being away all last night. Not too busy, though, not to see that you didn‚Äôt tell enough about$ecarted away in the wagon.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, Mr. King,‚Äù chimed in Hiram. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a big story to tell, and I‚Äôve been dying with curiosity all day long to know what it is$íGive us the story, Dashaway,‚Äù directed the airman.
Dave recited his adventures of the evening previous. Mr. King express$Tprofoundest wonderment as Dave gave the simple details of his mysterious kidnapping. His fine face broke out into indignation and anger as Hiram cried out eagerly:
‚ÄúNow then,$ó, tell him who was back of all this.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, are you sure I know?‚Äù asked Dave hesitatingly.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Dawsons, Mr. King,‚Äù declared Hiram. ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù and Hiram told about the two men whom he had seen conversing with Jerry Dawson.
${ sprang to his feet, deeply aroused.
‚ÄúSo that is the secret of the wrecking$Marvin machine,‚Äù he observed. ‚ÄúThere is not the less doubt in my mind that the Dawsons are at the bottom of all this mischief. Now then, lads, I don‚Äôt want you to even lisp your suspicions to an outsider.‚Äù
Both Dave and Hiram promise$©
y would obey the injunction.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to rid these meets of all this class of rascals, or know the reason,‚Äù declared the stirred-up airman with vehemence. ‚ÄúI shall have$maffair run down to the limit, and if I fasten the business on the Dawsons, it will be a satisfaction to see them barred from all future aero meets.‚Äù
Mr. King walked excitedly away in the direction of the Marvin hangar. The two friends remained$ªbench pile discussing the case in its various bearings.
Then Dave gave Hiram an inkl$Bat Grimshaw had him in active training for some reason soon to develop.
‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm going to get a chance to do$Ithing worth while in the aero line, Hiram,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow I used to dream about all this when I was back at Brookville.‚Äù
‚ÄúWas that where you lived, Dave?$&Yes.‚Äù And one confidence led to another, and Dave found an interested listener to the details of his past life.
‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôve had quite an experience, haven‚Äôt you, Dave?‚Äù said Hiram. ‚ÄúThat old guardian of yours is a mean one$√no mistake.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to be away from him,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù interrupted Hiram.
He jumped down from the bench pile, as he noticed a slouching figure moving stealthily$îthe other side of it.
‚ÄúDave,‚Äù exclaimed Hiram, ‚Äúdo you know I believe that fellow has been listening to every word we said.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, what of it?‚Äù asked Dave.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt$z
who he is?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fellow named Brooks. He works around the hangars at odd jobs, and is a regular crony of Jerry Dawson. Hey, you,‚Äù shouted Hiram after the receding figure, ‚Äúwhat you snooping$ìhere, playing the eavesdropper, for?‚Äù
‚ÄúHuh!‚Äù retorted the other, ‚Äúwhat you coming along for and waking up a fellow when he‚Äôs taking a nap in the cool of the evening?‚Äù
Then the$H	alked on. There was a sneer and a menace in his vicious tones.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù said Hiram, half to himself, $6anything or anybody that mixes up with Jerry Dawson.‚Äù
CHAPTER XXI

THE AMATEUR TROPHY
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your machine,‚Äù spoke Grimshaw, with a grin.
‚ÄúMy$/?‚Äù repeated Dave Dashaway.
‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs the biplane I expect to see you handle better than any operator on the field, or I shall be mightily disappointed.‚Äù
It was early morning. Just as breakfas$%over at the Aegis hangar, Grimshaw had appeared. He had nodded knowingly to Mr. King. Then he had taken Dave in tow; to lead him to his quarters, and back to a shed the doors of which$]just thrown open. The most exquisite little biplane upon which Dave had ever feasted his eyes was revealed to view.
‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù exclaimed Dave, ‚Äúwhere did it come from?‚Äù
‚ÄúFresh from the factory.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen$*Last night. We housed it when everybody was asleep. I suppose you understand, Dashaway?‚Äù
‚ÄúHardly,‚Äù answered Dave in a vague tone.
‚ÄúWhy, what have I been training you for, do you$Ñ?‚Äù
‚ÄúFor this, eh$What else? About a week ago the makers of that little beauty, which they call the Baby Racer, wrote to me asking if$0ould get a try out on the course here. They are stunting mostly for amateur patronage, and want to make a catchy showing. I fixed things with the show committee four days ago. The people who ow$≠machine pay me one hundred dollars for my trouble. Half of it is yours.‚Äù
‚ÄúFifty$9!‚Äù said Dave in a rapturous kind of a tone.
‚ÄúIt was hard work getting an extra number on the programme, but Mr. King has fixed that.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to be a regular entry, then?‚Äù aske$≤.
‚ÄúYes, it is, and a silver cup trophy for the best exhibition. Three other new machines are in the contest.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut,‚Äù demurred Dave modestly, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt expect me, a mere beginner‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúTo win the$±?‚Äù retorted Grimshaw, in one of his roaring moods. ‚ÄúI certainly do. Why, are you thinking of disgracing all my careful training, by making a fizzl$ythe chance of a lifetime!‚Äù
Dave was nearly overcome. He distrusted neither his own nerve nor the excellent training of his tutor, but the proposition$vso sudden it almost took his breath away.
‚ÄúSee here, Dashaway,‚Äù broke in the old man, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve done just what I told you in all our training stunts, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to, Mr. Grimshaw.$%Well, you just keep up those tactics right along, and I‚Äôll not steer$Ainto any mishaps. There‚Äôs a big bulletin down at the pylon announcing this flight. Now get yourself in trim, to show the airmen what you‚Äôre made of. Have the little beauty out and look at her.‚Äù
Dav$µfascinated glance rested on a rare combination of grace and utility, as the Baby Racer was run out from under cover.
The machine was not a large one. It was a model of compactness, and had every latest improvement. Grimshaw oper$ﬁthe wings.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an articulated biplane,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúSee here, where $Q	 are jointed and spread and close till they look like a big beetle. The fuselage is clear spruc$landing chassis is made of rattan strips. See those reinforced skids, and that four cylindered aerial motor? The owners said she ought to have a muffler, for she spouts like a blast furnace when$%tarts.‚Äù
Mr. King came up, smiling and looking pleased, while tutor and pupil were$,	over the Baby Racer. Then Hiram put in an appearance. He was so excited that he hopped around from place to place, telling Dave$8	was the luckiest boy in the world.
By and by the news spread of the arrival of a new model, and a crowd began to gather. Airmen looked over$_atty little machine and made their comments, pro$con. One fellow found all kinds of fault. Dave noticed that this was the most unpopular man with$Kthe field, and the employer of the Dawsons at the present time.
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to run her?‚Äù he asked of Grimshaw.
The old man placed a hand on Dave‚Äôs shoulder. The latter flushed modestly. The grumbler gave him a hard look.
‚ÄúThat kid$ñobserved disgustedly.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of my crack graduates, I‚Äôd have you know,‚Äù retorted Grimshaw, bridling up.
‚ÄúThat don‚Äôt make him eligible.‚Äù
‚ÄúEligible for what?‚Äù
‚ÄúRunning a machine on a licensed cours$G	I beg your pardon,‚Äù said Mr. King, stepping up, ‚Äúbut we have arranged all that. Here, Dashaway, keep that about you so you can answer any impudent questions.‚Äù
‚ÄúA pilot‚Äôs license, eh?‚Äù muttered the fault-finder‚Äî‚ÄúOh, then of course i$Iall right.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a pilot‚Äôs license,‚Äù Grimshaw told Dave after the fellow had sneaked away, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just as good as one. $|a special permit, and Mr. King‚Äôs word and influence stand good for you.‚Äù
Dave passed three anxious but busy hours up to the time when the extra feature advertised was announced$§Grimshaw and two assistants wheeled the Baby Racer out upon the running course.
‚ÄúHop in,‚Äù ordered Grimshaw, as the spotless new model was ranged in the row ready for the start.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the signal,‚Äù spoke his$ 
.
‚ÄúGo!‚Äù
Dave bounded up into the air, as he got into position in the roaring machine.
Like a gull he soared from the ground and circled about the meadows to the left of the course. The pure white wings of the Baby Racer were dazzling$¨sunlight, almost blinding the staring group of spectators.
Dave took in$.position of the three other contestants. Then he paid strict attention solely to the directions his proficient teacher had given him.
From a height of several hundred feet Dave cut off the motor and glided within fifteen feet$Ÿearth; then with a new roar the engine started again and up went the mammoth bird.
Not satisfied with his test, Dave speeded up and slowed down several times, and then darted to earth. Before the machine came to a full stop h$ºswooped upwards.
For a quarter of an hour the biplane soared above the course, made a final stop, and came back to the earth within a few feet of the starting place from its sensational flight in$Ålouds.
Dave caught the echo of vast cheering, and as he was hustled along to the Grimshaw quarters,$/conscious of being slapped on the back, of hearing approving comments. He was a little exhausted and light headed from the unusual spin, however, and glad to sit down in a reclining camp chair$/et his breath.
Grimshaw left him with Hiram, who had abandoned work for the hour to give full attention to his friend.
‚ÄúHow did I do,$b?‚Äù asked Dave.
‚ÄúYou did it all,$"declared his enthusiastic champion. ‚ÄúWhy, those other fellows just lopped around like lazy flies. Not one of them went up over two hund$Ñfeet.‚Äù
A little later they heard Grimshaw approaching. He was chuckling and talking to himself.
‚ÄúA big advertisement for my aviation school, hey?‚Äù he cried, bursting in upon the two friends. ‚ÄúDashaway, when you get rested just drop down to$Doffice and get that trophy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve won?‚Äù cried Dave.
‚ÄúSkill, rapidity and altitude‚Äîall three points,‚Äù was the glad announcement of the old aerial engineer.
Mr. King came into evidence a few minutes later.$ºm pretty proud of you, Dashaway,‚Äù he said, in his hearty, forcible way. ‚ÄúThis means a professional dash$jsoon, I can tell you.‚Äù
About an hour later Dave and Hiram were making their way to the Aegis hangar. As they passed one of the temporary refreshment stands they came upon a crowd of five boys.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jerry and his crowd,‚Äù whispere$π.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pay any attention to them, Hiram,‚Äù answered Dave.
‚ÄúI shan‚Äôt, unless they pester me,‚Äù replied Hiram.
With Jerry was the young rough, Brooks, the boy Dave an$@ had detected behind the pile of benches. Three others Dave recognized as young loafers who followe$Pmeets, working only occasionally.
They did not break ranks as they came up abreast of Dave and Hiram, halting them, which movement seemed preconcerted on their part.
‚ÄúSay, think you‚Äôve done it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù sneered Jerry, loo$ﬁstraight at Dave. ‚ÄúWell, make the most of it. You‚Äôll never take another fly.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt he?‚Äù challenged Hiram, making an aggressive forward movement. But Dave held him back.
‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve got you‚Äî$
 right, this time, Dave Dashaway. Back to nature, back to the farm for you‚Äîha! ha! ha!‚Äù
And Jerry‚Äôs companion joined him in his mocking jeer as they passed on their way.
CHAPTER XXII

A NIGHT ADVENTURE
‚ÄúHold on, Dave.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop m$	Well, I declare!‚Äù cried Hiram Dobbs.
The country lad, developed into a first class ‚Äúfield‚Äù man, was almost thrust aside by the young aviator.
Dave Dashaway had certainly won this latter distinction during$Rpast week. The morning of the cup trophy with the Baby Racer had been a start in the right direction. Two days later Dave had accompanied Mr. King in a non-stop race across the country, adding to the victory laurels of the popular airman, and$2	ast store of practical experience that the lad had already acquired.
Mr. King had now filled all the numbers on the programme for which he had entered. He had promised Dave some ‚Äúreal work,‚Äù as he termed it, $∞next meet. Then there had come an opportunity to enter Dave and the Aegis in a one hundred mile dash in which over half-a-dozen contestants were to take part.
For this, the most pretentious ‚Äústunt‚Äù h$∑yet attempted, Dave had been practicing all that day. Now, late in the afternoon, he and Hiram had strolled into the town. They were just passing the leading hotel of the place, when$®grabbed the arm of his companion so suddenly and excitedly that Hiram regarded him in wonder.
He noticed$.Dave was staring fixedly at a handsome blue painted automobile. That machine had just sped from the curb, a chauffeur in charge, a faultlessly dressed young fellow lolling back in the tonneau. Dave gasped, watched the auto whirl dow$6street at rapid speed, and then made a wild rush as if bent on following it.
‚ÄúHold on, Dave.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop m$	Well, I declare!‚Äù
Dave had run out into the street. Hiram kept pace with him, wondering what in the world it all meant. Suddenly $oturned in his course. He made a sudden dash for the curb where several taxicabs stood. Reaching one, of these, he touched the arm of its chauffeur waiting$oa fare.
‚ÄúQuick,‚Äù spoke Dave, ‚Äúfollow that blue car.‚Äù
‚ÄúHey, hello, who are you?‚Äù challenged the men, staring at Dave vaguely.
‚ÄúOh, afraid of your fare?‚Äù retorted Dave. ‚ÄúHere, I‚Äôve got over fifty dollars in my pocket book$∑
‚Äôs Dave Dashaway,‚Äù put in Hiram, as if that meant everything. ‚ÄúHe works for Mr. King‚Äîyou know him?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat crowd is good enough for me,‚Äù at once announced the chauffeur. ‚ÄúJump in. What$«your orders?‚Äù
Dave sprang into the tonneau. The marvelling Hiram followed his leader. He could not imagine what Dave was up to, but he had confidence enough in his associate to feel t$K	knew his business on every occasion.
‚ÄúThat blue car, the one that just left the curb,‚Äù began Dave, leaning over towards the chauffeur, who had touched the wheel promptly.
‚ÄúCollins‚Äô car, yes,‚Äù nodd$6man.
‚ÄúFollow it till it stops,‚Äù directed Dave.
‚ÄúThat will be at Genoa.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù
‚ÄúI heard the fare give the order$>Well, keep it in sight. Can you do it?‚Äù
‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù responded the chauffeur, starting up his machine.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt catch quite up with them. I want to get off when that boy stops.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù
T$à speeded up. As he turned the next street corner$rear red lights of the blue auto could be seen a square distant.
Dave settled back in the comfortable cushioned seat like a person letting down after a severe strain.
‚ÄúDave Dashaway,‚Äù broke in Hiram at length, unable to re$C his curiosity any longer, ‚Äúwhat does this mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, you heard me tell the chauffeur what I wanted,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúYou are following that boy.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes.$rDave?‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause I want to find out where he lives,‚Äù replied Dave.
‚ÄúWho is h$P	You remember my telling you about being robbed in a lodging house at Brompton, just before I came to Fairfield?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, yes. You mean by the fellow who got Mr. King‚Äôs medal and watch and money$VThat‚Äôs it.‚Äù
‚ÄúA boy with a scar on his cheek?‚Äù
‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù
‚ÄúHas this one, in that automobile?‚Äù
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see. $have to,‚Äù replied Dave. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there, though, don‚Äôt doubt it, for that is the fellow who robbed me.‚Äù
‚ÄúSure?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, yes, I‚Äôd know his face among a thousand.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy$É	you have him arrested?‚Äù
‚ÄúIf there had been a policeman in sight I would have done that, on my first impulse,‚Äù declared Dave. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt and I‚Äôve had time to think.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you going to do$ºFollow him to Genoa, find out where he stays, and make sure of getting him before he knows that I am on his track and becomes alarmed.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so. What you‚Äôre thinking of, too, I suppose, is Mr. King‚Äôs property?$Xit. Of course this boy thief has disposed of it, but if I get him cornered right he may be glad to tell where it is.‚Äù
Dave relapsed into thought, laying out his plans as to the$†in the auto ahead. Hiram had never been in an automobile before. He gave himself up to$Tenjoyment of the invigorating breeze and$rapid spin.
‚ÄúSay,‚Äù he broke out finally, as a new thought struck him, ‚Äúthat boy you‚Äôre after looked pretty finely dressed up, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt seems so,‚Äù responded Dave.
‚ÄúAnd hiring an automobile, too. He must have lots of money.$dStolen, probably,‚Äù said Dave.
The chauffeur seemed to thoroughly understand his business. He kept the blue car always in view, but progressed so as not to awaken any suspicion that he was following it.
Genoa was about twenty miles distant. T$édid not proceed very fast. It stopped at a little town on the way. Its passenger smoked a great many cigarettes, and seemed enjoying an easy, luxurious ride.
Dave‚Äôs car kept near to the blue auto as they reached the outskirts of Genoa. Finally$>
car halted in front of a hotel. Its passenger leaped to the curb, took out a roll of banknotes, and ostentatiously paid the chauffeur.
‚ÄúStop right here,‚Äù Dave ordered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù
He got to the sidewalk, and was directly$Âthe hotel as the boy he was following strutted through its entrance with an important air. As he came under the full glare of the electric light, Dave caught sight$)tell-tale scar on his cheek.
The fellow did not much resemble the lodging house boy. His hair was neatly cared for,$blothes were of the most expensive kind. For all the world, he suggested a person with plenty of money to spend and wealthy relations.
The boy went up to the desk$ñhotel clerk, who bowed and smiled to him as though he was some favored and welcome guest. The clerk handed him a key, and the boy went over to the elevator and stepped in. Dave quickly hastened$6desk.
‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I wish to see the young man who just got his key.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, room 47. Take the elevator,‚Äù vouchsafed the clerk.
‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù
Dave waited till$I had come down. Then he went up to the fourth floor. He went down a corridor, scanning the little porcelain numbers on the doors.
‚ÄúHere it is,‚Äù he said eagerly to himself‚Äî‚ÄúNo. 47.‚Äù
A light showed through its transom. Tap‚Äît$! Dave knocked smartly on the door panel. Some one, whistling and bustling about within the room, moved to$Q	, unlocked it, and Dave stood face to face with the boy who had robbed him in the lodging house at Brompton.
CHAPTER XXIII

A GREAT SURPRISE
Dave looked$i	he had followed and run to cover squarely in the eye. There could be no mistake as to his identity. The scar on his face showed plainly. For all of his gay clothes and jaunty appearance, the fellow had the same repellant features that Dav$Ìnoticed at the lodging house the night he was robbed.
For a minut$&fellow looked surprised. Then his memory quickened to recognition. He turned pale,$5lips trembled, and he blurted out unsteadily:
‚ÄúW‚Äîwhat do you want?‚Äù
‚ÄúI want you,‚Äù said Dave simply and sternly.
Quick as a flash the boy thief realized his situation, it seemed. He made a move for which$twas unprepared. Making a light spring, one hand extended, he swept Dave clear of the threshold$room, and sent him crashing back against the other wall of the corridor.
Before Dave could recover himself the door was violently slammed shut. Dave heard the key turn in the lock. Then there were hurried movements abou$¥room.
Dave was mad at being outwitted. H$determined, too. He threw himself against the door, but could not budge it.
‚ÄúOpen this door!‚Äù he shouted, pounding upon the panels. ‚ÄúIt will be the better for you.‚Äù
No attention was paid to this. Dave continued to hammer on$æ	.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a thief!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll rouse the whole hotel and leave you publicly disgraced if you don‚Äôt come out. I want back$Vproperty you stole from me, and I‚Äôm bound to have it.‚Äù
Dave made a spring. His foot landed on the outside door knob. He caught at the tilted transom to steady himself. Just then a figure came hurrying down the corridor. Dave‚Äô$ñwas seized and he was dragged to the floor.
‚ÄúHere, what you up to, with all this noise?‚Äù demanded his captor, a hall man of the hotel, by his uniform.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a thief in that room,‚Äù cried Dave breathlessly.
‚ÄúA thief?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes.$How do you know?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe robbed me. He just slammed the door in my face. Have you a key to that room?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, yes, but‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúUnlock$Y	, then. I‚Äôll face him down for you. You can take both of us to the hotel clerk, and$Nspeak the truth.‚Äù
The hall man hesitated a trifle, but Dave‚Äôs earnest urging induced him to produce a bunch of keys. Dave rushed into the room. He looked all around it.
‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúit‚Äôs empty! The fellow is gone!‚Äù
Dave peer$qa closet, under a bed, and then ran to the window. There the hall man was looking at a coat and hat lying on the platform of the fire escape, just outside$!casement.
‚ÄúThis is a queer go,‚Äù he said, slowly and dubiously, ‚Äúbut there seems to be something to your story.‚Äù
‚ÄúI should think there was, a whole lot,‚Äù declared Dave. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat$The fellow has escaped. He knew I was bound to get into this room. Those things fell out of his satchel as he got through the window.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,$5is gone, that‚Äôs so,‚Äù observed the hall man. ‚ÄúSay, you had better report this to the clerk.‚Äù
Dave was very much disturbed and disappointed. There could be no doubt$¢ the boy thief had escaped by$window route. It would probably be in vain to try to follow him now. Dave dashed out into the corridor and ran down the stairs, not waiting for the elevator.
The clerk was talking to a guest, polite and imperturbable. He simply inclined his head as$¥burst forth:
‚ÄúThe boy in 47.‚Äù
‚ÄúAh, yes!‚Äù answered the hotel clerk.
‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù
The clerk turn$3big register around, flipped back a page or two, and set his finger on a name.
Dave read it, and nearly fell down where he stood. He had never been so startled and dumbfounded in his life. The name on the$…	, written in a big, sprawling hand was‚Äî‚Äî
‚ÄúDave Dashaway!‚Äù
Dave grasped the marble counter slab for support with both hands. He g$?and started.
‚ÄúMy name!‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúWhy, what does this mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the trouble?‚Äù inquired the guest, who had been conversing with the clerk. He could not help but notice Dave‚Äôs perturbation.
$¨‚Äù cried Dave, ‚ÄúI followed a fellow here, to room 47. He is a thief. He robbed me of valuable property two weeks ago. He just slammed the door of his$iin my face.‚Äù
‚ÄúA thief?‚Äù spoke the clerk, arching his eyebrows. ‚ÄúAre you pretty sure?$QI should think so,‚Äù retorted Dave, ‚Äúseeing that, rather than meet me, he has made off by the fire escape, baggage and all.‚Äù
The hotel clerk blinked in his usual calm way, but touched a bell to summon the hall man from$Éourth floor.
‚ÄúAnd he stole my name,‚Äù cried Dave. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
‚ÄúIs that your name?‚Äù inquired the clerk, pointing to the register.
‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù assented Dave.
‚ÄúStrange. Let me see, forty-seven‚ÄîDashaway,‚Äù an$x went to a case covered with little cards and selected one. ‚ÄúOh, yes, has been here twice in a week. Prompt pay. Old gentlemen$ihim here once, grandfather, I believe. Very respectable old man.‚Äù
‚ÄúSee here,‚Äù said Dave realizing that he was wasting time, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make you any trouble, but I must report this to the police$íThe only thing to do, I should say,‚Äù replied the clerk.
‚ÄúWhere is the nearest police station?‚Äù
‚ÄúTwo squares down, one square south.$*hank you,‚Äù said Dave, and darted away.
He hurried out of the hotel and up to the automobile he had recently left.
‚ÄúWait here,‚Äù he directed Hiram.
‚ÄúIs it the boy you supposed?‚Äù ask$/Yes. I can‚Äôt explain now. I‚Äôll be back in five minutes.‚Äù
Dave was not afraid to face the police on this occasion. He could now use the name of Mr. King. He planned to hav$Wget promptly on the trail of$boy thief.
Dave located the police station and ran up its steps. At a desk in a large room sat the office clerk, writing.
‚ÄúI want to report a case of robbery,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúAll right, see the lieutenant,‚Äù respond$∆clerk.
‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his room yonder,‚Äù was the reply, and the man pointed to a small room leading off from$1in apartment. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs off with a squad, but he‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù
Dave moved over to the open doorway indicated. He was greatly excit$;all the incidents of the past two hours, and hardly had the patience to wait for the lieutenant.
He decided to go into the room, however, and$Fofficial‚Äôs return. The minute he stepped across the threshold, however, he was aware that the room held two occupants.
Then Dave Dashaway discovered something else, that was the surprise of his life. First one, and then the other of the$Ö of the room arose in a hurry.
‚ÄúWhy, what luck‚Äîthe very boy!‚Äù sounded one voice.
‚ÄúDave Dashaway!‚Äù cried the other.
And the boy aviator came to a standstill with a shock, as he recognized his old guardian, Silas Warner, a$hsheriff from Brookville.
CHAPTER XXIV

SOMETHING WRONG
Dave was a good deal disheartened. It was several hours after his meeting with the two persons he wished most to avoid. And now $Äprisoner.
He sat crowded up on the back seat of a rickety old wagon, covered with canvas top and sides, and boarded up at$[	. Beside him was his foxy-eyed, ferret-faced guardian, old Silas Warner. On the front seat, acting as driver,$athe Brookville sheriff. Around Dave‚Äôs wrist was what is called a ‚Äúcome-along,‚Äù or rope handcuff, its two crossed stay pieces of wood being held tightly by the watchful, sleepless Warner.
The way this had all come about seemed like a dream to$Ÿ. The instant that his guardian and the sheriff had recognized the runaway they were seeking, they had pounced down upon poor Dave like hungry wolves.
Silas Warner held our hero while$îurried out into the main room of the station. He spoke a few words to the police clerk, and then Dave was led out$Tplace, both men holding tightly to him, and soon found himself in a room in a cheap boarding house.
Dave had tried to expostulate, to explain. His jubilant captors had refused to listen$ö. He had frantically begged of them to allow him to send word to some friends, to take a simple message to the police lieutenant.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust him for a minute, Daniel Jackson,‚Äù his guardian shouted$esheriff. ‚ÄúYou know what a slippery one he is.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs important,‚Äù pleaded Dave. ‚ÄúA fellow robbed me. He must be caught.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll a pack of lies,‚Äù declared old Warner. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust him or listen to him, S$‡He‚Äôs trying to get his friends to rescue him,$)put on time to delay us, and slip.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, indeed, no,‚Äù answered Dave desperately.
‚ÄúShut up. Sheriff, we‚Äôll make our plan$kbundle this boy back to Brookville quick as we can get him there.‚Äù
Over Dave the sheriff kept close watch and ward while Warner went away to make arrangements of which$`learned later. It was long after midnight when these plans were perfected. By that time, from the conversation of the two men, Dave found out a great deal that was new to him, and astonished him not a little.
It seemed that by the sheerest accident$áo men had come across Dave at a time when they were on their way to Dayton to arrest him. T$0that city, because Jerry Dawson had written Warner that there he would find his runaway ward.
This was the reason why Jerry had boasted to Dave that$W
not make any more air flights. His crony, Brooks, had overheard Dave tell Hiram all about his guardian and the circumstances of his leaving home,$+	mean-spirited Jerry had been quick to take advantage of the chance to get his rival into trouble.
It seemed that Warner, with his usual miserly penuriousness had hired the sheriff to ‚Äúwork cheap.‚Äù The$∫got as far as Genoa through ‚Äúlifts‚Äù in variou$,m wagons. They had taken the cheapest lodgings that evening they could find$C sheriff and Warner happened to be at the police station, because the former had a slight acquaintance with the lieutenant, and was waiting to see him when Dave arrived.
Silas$£
d managed to hire a sorry nag and a miserable wreck of an old milk wagon to convey them back to Brookville. Dave‚Äôs feelings may be imagined when he found himself in the clutches of the enemy. He had been in torment to think that Hiram and$Jhauffeur would wait for him vainly. He wondered what Mr. King would think of this second unusual absence. Most of all, poor Dave nearly wept when a thought of the great air race$morrow came into his mind. He would miss the grand event in which he had hoped to take so proud a part.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awful, just$‚Äù reflected Dave, feeling well-nigh crushed, ‚Äúand no hope of my getting any word of explanation to my friends.‚Äù
It must have been two o‚Äôclock in the morning whe$wagon come to a halt. Dave had caught sight of lights ahead on the road as they jogged along. Then strains of music grew plainer. The shouts of merry makers filled the air.
It appeared that$shad reached a roadhouse with a dancing pavilion and park attached to it, much in favor with excursion parties from the country around. Outside of the place stood a hayrack with four horses$Ñ	.
‚ÄúHorse needs a rest, Warner,‚Äù the sheriff declared, ‚Äúand some refreshment wouldn‚Äôt hurt you and me, hey?‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing for me, Sheriff, n$‚Äù the miserly old fellow was quick to retort. ‚ÄúOf course you can buy what you want‚Äîwith your own money.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust so. Well, I‚Äôll stretch my limbs a little and sort of see$kthat jolly crowd is up to.‚Äù
The old man kept his tight hold on Dave. He would silence the youth every time the latter tried to talk or reason with him or question him. With low mutterings and chuckles he hinted that the law$òee to it that Dave did not again ‚Äúdesert his comfortable home.‚Äù
It was fully four o‚Äôclock when the sheriff came back to the wagon. He pulled himself up in$%seat like an overfed porpoise.
‚ÄúJust going to break up, that crowd,‚Äù he observed, ‚Äúand having a great time. I wish I was young again. Get up, there$Uadded to the horse.
Dave made up his mind that he would be given no chance to escape, at least during the trip to Brookville.
There came a rumbling behind them as$ö
 was plodding along a narrow country road with a deep ditch on either side of it. Then singing voices broke the silence. The party from the roadhouse was homeward bound.
The road twisted and turned. At its$∏est part, before the sleepy-headed driver could realize it, the great loaded hayrack wagon lumbered by. Its side grazed the inside wheels of the$<the sheriff was driving.
‚ÄúHey, look out!‚Äù yelled the officer.
Derisive shouts answered him. There was a crash, a tip over, and down the embankment went horse, wagon and passengers. The hayrack crowd indulged in mocking cat calls as if it$ågreat joke, and went on without anybody trying to find out what damage had been done.
The horse broke loose from the rotten old shafts of the wagon before it rolled over twice. The frame$4box cover was crushed in and the wooden end was reduced to kindling wood.
Dave was jerked free from his guardian, rope handcuff and all. He land$} great clump of bushes, was slightly jarred, and lay there for a minute or two.
‚ÄúThe scoundrels!‚Äù roared the sheriff, extricating himself from a nest$çrambles. ‚ÄúWhat you whining about, Warner?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve torn my best coat all down the back, and I‚Äôve got a lump on my head big as a goose egg.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the priso$ÉHi, whoop! That‚Äôs so, Sheriff, he$loped.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat! after all our trouble?‚Äù
That was enough to rouse up Dave. Now was his chance. Day was just breaking, but i$Odark and dim down in the ditch. On hands and knees, bending down low, the boy crept along its windings. Where the road turned and$m
 followed it, he felt safe in rising to his feet and starting on a keen run.
Dave did not venture to climb up to the road as yet. His late captors would certainly make some kind of a search for him. He kept o$äning along in the dry ditch, out of view from the road. Its bottom was rock strewn, and several times his feet became tangled up in trailing vines. Finally, all unaware of what he was headi$µto, Dave plunged into a maze of bushes to take a direct tumble where the ditch dropped suddenly nearly a dozen feet.
It was a gravel pit$Öhad fallen into, and a heavy tree stump lay at its bottom. Dave‚Äôs head struck this as he landed, and he was stunned.
He was conscious of partially rousing a little later. In a dreamy, dazed way the main idea in his mind was that$Ävery sleepy. Dave passed into another spell of insensibility. He awoke with a start finally, to find the sun shining brightly on his face.
‚ÄúOh, the mischief!‚Äù exclaimed$†, as he realized that the day was several hours old.
The boy felt of his head. He found a lump there, but he was as bright as a dollar otherwise. He was immensely satisfied to find himself free. I$Ålate captors had searched for him, they had looked in the wrong direction.
Dave got up on the roadway an$>	up and down it. No one was in sight. He crossed it, plunged through the timber, and reaching a north and south road faced the sun on a pretty good sprint.
Dave wondered what had become of his guardian, and the sheriff$
wrecked milk wagon. It seemed certain that sooner or later his enemies would look for him at Dayton. The lad did not mind that so much just now. He had great faith in Mr. King, and he believed that the airman would find some way to circumvent$∏.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs missing the race that makes me feel bad,‚Äù ruminated Dave. ‚ÄúOf course they‚Äôll find a substitute to take my place.‚Äù
A mile down$~oad Dave came to a farmhouse. The men folks were out in the field and the mistress was just washing up her breakfast dishes. She prepared a hasty meal for Dave, which refreshed him considerably. She direct$to the nearest town, gave him a clear idea of his bearings, and told him it was nine o‚Äôclock.
‚ÄúThey are just starting at the meet,‚Äù said Dave rather mournfully, as he proceeded on his way. ‚ÄúThat lady$FClyde is two miles ahead. Why, I remember now, $/	one of the towns on the rout$	one hundred mile dash. Some of the contestants ought to be passing over the place insid$=	next fifteen minutes.‚Äù
A farmer came along in a light wagon and gave Dave a lift. Just as they drove into Clyde, the man made the sudden remark:
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one of them airship$†Over towards the southeast a whizzing monoplane was speeding on its way.
‚ÄúThe race is on,‚Äù decided Dave$$re‚Äôs another!‚Äù cried his companion, and stopp$wagon and got out. Dave followed his example, thanked him for the lift, and, looking upwards, walked on to a rise where he could get a better view of the air movements.
In turn four machines came into view. One or two$Gm were near enough for Dave to recognize. A queer qualm came over him as a fifth machine drove a course directly$4the town.
‚ÄúThe racing monoplane I was to have run,‚Äù he said breathlessly. ‚ÄúI wonder who has taken my place? Hello‚Äîsomething wrong!‚Äù
Like a soaring eagle suddenly wounded, the$°dropped one wing. It curvetted under a manipulation of the rudder. Then with no reason apparent for the strange movement, the monoplane tilted at a sharp angle.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone‚Äîit‚Äôs a smash up!‚Äù shouted Dave in a transport$∞wildest anxiety and alarm.
To a casual observance the daring airman aloft was simply giving spectators a stock thrill. Dave realized instantly that something was wrong.
To him i$iapparent that the operator of$racing monoplane had unaccountably lost entire control of his machine, and was headed for sure destruction.
CHAPTER XXV

CONCLUSION
Dave came to a dead halt with a shock. In deep distress and suspense he watched the div$ÿ. On every expert calculation, machine and operator were doomed.
Dave expected every moment to see the operator thrown out of the seat. He could not conceive what was passing in the mind of$[. The machine did not seem to be crippled. Dave doubted if the most daring airman would risk that dangerous glide unless compelled to do so.
‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs good‚Äîgrand!‚Äù fairly shouted Dave, as, one hundred feet from the ground,$Ænoplane slowed, described two mammoth circles, and then resuming the descent, reached the earth, rolled almost fifty feet, and came to a safe halt.
Dave started on a dead run for the spot. Others from all directions preceded him. By the time he$ße place where the monoplane had landed, it was surrounded ten deep by crowding excited people.
‚ÄúIs he dead?‚Äù Dave heard one ask.
‚ÄúNo, only hurt.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù said Dave to himself in a startled way, ‚Äúit‚Äôs Mr. Worthington.‚Äù
Dav$‘been able to peer through the crowd. He made out the monoplane, safe and trim, at rest. Some men were lifting the operator out of it. Dave recognized him as one of the professional aviators$meet.
‚ÄúHere, young fellow, don‚Äôt crowd so,‚Äù remonstrated a gaping spectator, as Dave tried to press through the throng.
‚ÄúI know that man,‚Äù explained Dave. ‚ÄúPlease let me get to him.‚Äù
Dave cleared the$±and hurried over to where they had placed Mr. Worthington on the grass. The latter looked white and exhausted. He held a handkerchief to his lips, and Dave noticed that it was red stained.
‚ÄúOh,$ö,‚Äù spoke Dave, kneeling at the side of the prostrate man. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know me?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, Dashaway!‚Äù replied the aviator, trying to smile. ‚ÄúYou her$K	Are you injured?‚Äù
‚ÄúHemorrhage, Doctor told me my lungs couldn‚Äôt stand the upper currents. Too strong for me. Fainted away. Caught myself just in time.$åGet a doctor,‚Äù spoke Dave to the men.
‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù demurred Worthington. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all right now. No more air sailing for me for a time, though, I fancy. Say, Dashaway!‚Äù
In a spurt of excitement$à sat up, and his eyes glowed as he fixed his glance on Dave.
‚ÄúI was in the lead,‚Äù he resumed.
‚ÄúI saw you was.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúContinue the race?‚Äù supplemented$Ç
Yes.‚Äù
‚ÄúShall I?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose a moment. She‚Äôs the best and fastest machine in the race$2
done 460 miles in 8: 17: 30. There‚Äôs 18 gallons of gasoline aboard and five of lubricating oil.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know all about it‚Äîthe route marked out, too,‚Äù said Dave.
‚ÄúThen win the day!‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll try$lGive him a start,‚Äù cried the enthused aviator to the men about him; and in thirty seconds the racing monoplane was once again driving for the sky.
All that Worthington had said about the$Vthe machine certainly deserved. Dave had never handled so capable a flyer. It was equipped with a marine compass for cross country work, and the acetylene light$1night flying.
‚ÄúGrass cutting to the heart‚Äôs content in this beauty!‚Äù cried Dave.
He was all on his mettle, the way things had turned out, and made a superb start. The machin$[in splendid trim. Dave took one good look ahead, behind and sideways, and then devoted all his attention to the business of the hour.
He had studied out the route the day previous. As on the hill at Clyde, each town$ course had a white flag hoisted at the highest point in town, with the monogram in black of the national aero club.
It was about thirty-five miles to the turning$s, fifty more back. As Dave started the return dash, he passed his rivals straggling along, the nearest one five miles from the first goal.
Once on$ptrip, Dave dropped to the ground, on a level meadow where a gaping farmer and his four employees stood fascinated at his graceful descent. The engine was not working at its best speed.$≥gave it a brief rest, impressed the farm hands into service, and started up the engine by swinging the propellor. This operation required more caution than cranking an automobile. With the switch off, Dave turned$r several times to fill the cylinders with gas, leaving it just ahead of the dead center of one of$K, and with one blade extending upwards. Then he was off on the home stretch.
It was plain sailing now. Town after town Dave passed and t$_saw the aero course in the distance. He made straight for the grounds, for two machines were racing at their best only a mil$c
 in his wake. As the gasoline was consumed the monoplane increased its speed, and as the essence gave out, just before making the final landing dip, the machine must have been making over seventy miles an hour.
‚ÄúHurrah! h$‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs Dashaway!$	ere‚Äôs Worthington?‚Äù
Dave smiled in a happy way at old Grimshaw and Hiram, who were among the thr$at crowded about the landed racer. He made a brief explanation and was borne in triumph to the King hangar by his delighted friends.
It took Dave an hour to satisfy the curious and excited Hiram with an$òof his mysterious disappearance of the evening previous, and the story of his arriving at Clyde just in time to complete Worthington‚Äôs broken trip.
This part of$fsoon got about the grounds. It added a new lustre to the exploit of the hour. Worthington arrived in the camp an hour later, not much the worse for his accident.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made it, lad!‚Äù cried old Grimshaw in delight. $<got a record to go on now that older hands would give their ears for.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am glad,‚Äù said Dave simply, and he was, indeed, very glad and$happy.
Only one feature marred the pleasure of the occasion. Mr. King was not at the hangars. Hiram explained that he and the automobile chauffeur had waited till midnight where Dave had left them at Genoa. Then, alarm$æy had sped back to Dayton and had told Mr. King all they knew about the strange affair.
‚Äú$4	said he would fathom the mystery and find you, if he had to give up business for a week,‚Äù explained Hiram.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a grand friend,‚Äù said Dave with emotion.
Dave,$B and Grimshaw had just finished supper when Mr. King appeared. He looked tired, but his cheery laugh rang out as he slapped his young protege heartily on the shoulder.
‚ÄúI$name of wonder, what is this I hear about you, Dashaway?‚Äù he cried.
‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Mr. King?‚Äù asked Dave.
‚ÄúYou won the race.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù repli$6 modestly.
‚ÄúPicked up Worthington at Clyde, when everything seemed off for the machine I backed.‚Äù
Dave explained. He had an attentive listener. When Dav$%concluded, Mr. King remarked:
‚ÄúI‚Äôll settle the outrageous claims of that annoying old guardian of yours in double quick time, Dashaway.‚Äù
‚ÄúCan it be done?‚Äù inquired Dave, anxiously.
‚ÄúTrust me for that.‚Äù
‚ÄúI intend to$	‚Äôve been pretty busy on your affairs, Dashaway,‚Äù proceeded the airman. ‚ÄúFrom what Hiram here told me, I had a clew to start on. At the hotel at Genoa I found out about that boy thief you tried to catch. Finally$Pclerk remembered a chum of his in the town. I located him, and ran on the fellow I was after. His name is Gregg.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe made the hotel people think it was Dave Dashaway.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a story to that.‚Äù
‚ÄúPlease tell it, Mr. Kin$|	Why, the young scamp found some papers among the stuff he stole from you.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù nodded Dave, ‚Äúsome letters directed to my father at Brookville.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey were from an old friend of your father, a man named Cyrus Da$K
Why, yes,‚Äù exclaimed Dave, ‚ÄúI know he once had a great friend by that name.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, the letters, never answered, invited your father to bring you to see an old friend who had become a wealthy man. He did not know that$awas dead when he wrote them. This young Gregg was smart enough to see a chance to work into the favor of Mr. Dale. He went to him and was at once accepted as Dave Dashaway.$D	 practically adopted him, gave him all the money he could spend, and Gregg was in high clover till I nabbed him.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe confessed all that, did he?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúHe did. I made him sign a$Kion and tell where he had sold my watch and medal. I‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôll have a friendly and influential second father, when we tell Mr. Dale that you are the real Dave Dashaway.‚Äù
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt$}better friend than you are, Mr. King,‚Äù declared Dave, ‚Äúif I searched for a thousand years.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a new one come on the scene you may take quite a fancy to,‚Äù replied$ô
 with a mysterious smile.
‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù inquired Dave.
‚ÄúYou remember the people who sent the Baby Racer on here for a test?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, yes‚Äîthe Interstate Aeroplane people, you mean?‚Äù repli$ìWell, I met their agent as I came in at the gate. He will be here shortly to see you.‚Äù
‚ÄúTo see me?‚Äù questioned Dave.
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat about?$	y, after that fine work of yours with the Baby Racer, and your record to-day, he thinks you‚Äôre the likely, lively, up-to-date aviator he wants to deal with. He is going to offer to make a contract with you to exhibit their new hydroplane. La$Óey will put their hydro-aeroplane on the market.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood for Dashaway!‚Äù cried the irrepressible Hiram Dobbs. ‚ÄúHurrah!‚Äù
‚ÄúWe can chorus that, all of us,‚Äù declared the genial airman. ‚ÄúAs a promising young aviator, Dave$ß	 is certainly a decided success.‚Äù
So we leave Dave for the present, at the threshold of his first professional triumph. In our next volume, entitled ‚ÄúD$oshaway and His Hydroplane; Or, Daring Adventures Over the Great Lakes,‚Äù his experience in a more brilliant field of aviation will be related.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be an aviator myself some day,‚Äù said Hiram, on$uthan one occasion. ‚ÄúBut, try my best, I won‚Äôt ever be a better birdman $KDave Dashaway!‚Äù
THE END.
