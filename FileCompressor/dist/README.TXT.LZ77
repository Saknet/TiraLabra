automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each$d files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go$‚dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "FileCompressor.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and$Oe ZIP file.

Notes:

* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first
JAR file is copied to the lib folder.
* Only JAR files are$/If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)
are not copied.
* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path element
specified in the manifest,the content of the$@ has to be on
the projects runtime path.
* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click $Y node
in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the
